<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>There is surely no country in the world where
hearts so thinly covered beat so warmly as in the
Emerald Isle. Wherever one travels,—over the
bare mountains of Donegal and the rocks and
cliffs of the northern coast, or among the blue
lakes and green fields of the South,—he will always
find a merry greeting and a hearty Irish welcome.
The boys and girls have a smile and a cheerful
word for every wind that blows; and that day is a
rare one, indeed, which is not sunny with laughter
and singing, even while clouds hide the blue sky
and Irish rains are falling.</p>

<p>The wonder is that Irish boys and girls can find
it in their hearts to leave their beautiful, loving
land of the shamrock. So many fairy lakes were
never found in any other country. Green meadows
never offered sweeter resting places than those of
the Emerald Isle; yet its young people turn their
backs to it, and their blue eyes toward the more
barren worlds beyond the seas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span></p>

<p>This story of Irish Kathleen gives glimpses of
ancient Ireland, as well as pictures of the life of
to-day with its tales of wee folk and giants, its
picnics and turf-cutting, its dancing and sheep-shearing,
its hunting and farming.</p>

<p>Kathleen lives first with her father up among
the mountains of lonely Donegal; she goes with
her little sister to spend a summer in County Sligo,
and she lives a year with her ten cousins, the
Malones of old Kilkenny, and a jolly, rollicking
brood she finds them. She learns something of
the history of Ireland from her father, and hears
the story of the life of the good Saint Patrick; but
she enjoys also the Gaelic tales which her grandmother
tells her about the fairies, and the story of
Finn MacCool, which she hears when she goes with
her uncle to see the Giant’s Causeway.</p>

<p class="center">THE SHOEMAKER OF DONEGAL</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Tell</span> me the story again, Kathleen.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell it to you here, Mary Ellen,” whispered
her sister. “Sure, he might be under the
hedge this minute and hear me talking about him.
Come to the top of the hill and I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>Mary Ellen slipped her hand into Kathleen’s, and
the two children stole softly away from the door-stone
where they had been playing. Their bare feet
made no sound on the green grass, and the old
grandmother, who was spinning at the door of the
cottage, did not even look up as they passed.</p>

<p>A thick fuchsia hedge bordered the plot of green
grass that surrounded the cottage, shutting out the
barren field behind the house. Slipping through the
hedge, the little girls followed the narrow foot-path
that led across the field to the top of the hill.</p>

<p>“I’m thinkin’ of a riddle Danny gave me the
morn,” said Kathleen, as they ran along the path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span></p>

<p>“Give it to me,” said Mary Ellen eagerly, and
Kathleen laughed merrily as she repeated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From house to house it goes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A wanderer small and slight;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And whether it rains or snows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">It sleeps outside in the night.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I’ll never guess it; tell it to me now, alanna,”
begged her sister.</p>

<p>“If your blue eyes could see the little <i>path</i> under
your feet you would <i>see</i> the answer,” replied Kathleen,
as she led the blind child carefully over the
steep pathway to the long stone slab where they
loved to play. “We’ll sit here a bit,” she added,
and drew Mary Ellen down beside her on the stone.</p>

<p>“Now tell me why you put the dish of stirabout
under the hawthorn bush last night, and what became
of it,” asked the child, who could wait no
longer for the story.</p>

<p>“It was for the leprecaun,” Kathleen told her.
“He is the fairy shoemaker, and he sits under the
hedge all day tapping away on an old shoe. He
wears a scarlet cap and a green coat, and there are
two rows of buttons on his coat, with seven buttons
in each row. He has a fairy purse which is
filled with gold, and he puts it down beside him on
the grass while he works; but he is always watching
it. If I could just see him once and hold his eye
for a minute, I could snatch the purse of gold and
run away with it.”</p>

<p class="p2"></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span></p>

<p>“Did you ever see him?” whispered Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>“No,” replied her sister; “but I have heard him
tapping on his shoe many a time. Once I saw his
scarlet cap under the hedge, but when I knelt down
to look closer he threw sand in my eyes, as he always
does, and was gone in a winkin’.”</p>

<p>“Belike it was a humming-bird,” said Mary Ellen.
“Danny says the hedge is full of their nests. But
what would you do with the purse, Kathleen dear?”</p>

<p>Kathleen’s eyes filled with tears and she looked
at her sister with a sad face. “Oh, darlin’, it’s for
you,” she said, “to give you the sight in your pretty
blue eyes. I’m thinkin’ of it all the time, and faith,
some day I’ll find a way. That’s why I took the
dish of oaten stirabout and put it under the hawthorn
bush last night, and why I put the bowl of
milk on the window ledge. It’s for the ‘good people,’
so that they’ll know we take thought of them.”</p>

<p>“Did the ‘good people’ drink the milk?” asked
the blind child eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, Mary Ellen,” said her sister, “but, listen!
The stirabout was gone this morning, dish and all.
The leprecaun must have taken it. I shall watch
for him the night, and if I do catch the old shoemaker’s
eye, I’ll hold it till he gives me his purse.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinkin’ that no one has ever held it yet,"<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
said Mary Ellen, snuggling against Kathleen’s
shoulder, as if there might be some danger in holding
a fairy dwarf spellbound with the look of one’s
eye.</p>

<p>Kathleen lowered her voice and asked mysteriously,
“Whist, Mary Ellen, do you mind old Granny
Connor?”</p>

<p>“She that lives beyond the bog?” questioned
Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Kathleen.</p>

<p>“I mind that she lives all alone, and that the
father tells us not to go near her,” answered her
sister. “She’s too friendly with the fairies.”</p>

<p>“Last night,” said Kathleen, taking her sister’s
hand, and looking into her blue eyes while her own
grew big and dark, “when I was driving the little
cow home across the bog, who should I meet under
the old oak tree but Granny Connor herself.</p>

<p>“I picked a bit of shamrock and held it tight in
my hand, but she stopped me and made me talk
to her, and she told me that it is our own father,
himself, that has a purse from the leprecaun.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not believe it,” said her sister quickly.
“If he had, he’d not be making shoes all day by
himself.”</p>

<p>But Kathleen shook her head. “Granny Connor
told me,” she confided, “that he has made a bargain
with the fairy dwarf, and must make shoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
all day long, or go wandering over the mountains
a-tinkerin’.”</p>

<p>“What’s that you’re saying, Kathleen?” a voice
behind them asked suddenly, and the children
jumped up in surprise.</p>

<p>A man with a leather apron tied round his waist
was standing beside the stone slab. It was hard
to tell where he had come from so quickly, for there
had been no sign of any one near when Kathleen
climbed to the top of the hill.</p>

<p>“It is the father himself,” said Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>The shoemaker seated himself on the big stone
and drew his little daughters down beside him; but
it was such an unusual thing for him to spare any
time from his work that they sat awkwardly within
the shelter of his arms, waiting for him to speak.</p>

<p>Kathleen wondered how much of their talk he
had heard, and whether he would scold her for
listening to old Granny Connor, and repeating the
tales to her little sister. She hung her head in
silence, and Mary Ellen felt as if the sunshine had
been darkened by a cloud; but the father’s arms
were around both little girls to hold them, although
he did not speak for some time.</p>

<p>“So you have been listening to old Granny Connor,”
he said at last.</p>

<p>Kathleen stole a look into his face, which always
had a kindly smile for everyone. “I did not mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
any wrong,” she said timidly. “I was only wanting
to find some way to help Mary Ellen.”</p>

<p>“What would you be doing for Mary Ellen?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I’d like to find some way to get money so that
she might go to Dublin and have a doctor cure her
eyes,” said the child simply.</p>

<p>“And so you put a dish of stirabout where the
little old shoemaker might see it?” asked her
father.</p>

<p>Both the children nodded their heads.</p>

<p>“How did you find out about the fairy dwarf?”</p>

<p>“Great-grandmother Connell and Grandmother
Barry talk about him in Gaelic. Sometimes Grandmother
Barry tells us what they are saying,” answered
Kathleen. “And last night I asked old
Granny Connor to tell me more.”</p>

<p>“What did she say?” asked her father.</p>

<p>“She said that people call you the leprecaun of
Donegal, because of the two rows of buttons in
sevens on your green frieze coat.”</p>

<p>The shoemaker laughed. “And where do they
think I keep my money?” he asked.</p>

<p>“They say you have it hidden in a purse that can
never grow empty, and that you keep it in the place
where you mend your shoes,” the child replied, looking
away from her father and off across the bog to
the purple mountains. “And no one knows where<span class="pagenum" id="age_7">[7]</span>
it is that you have your work-bench,” she added
with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Look at me, Kathleen,” said her father.</p>

<p>The child turned her gray eyes up to his, gray
and honest like her own.</p>

<p>“Did you think when you put the dish of stirabout
under the hawthorn bush last night, that you
would see me take it up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” cried Kathleen. “Sure, I thought
it would be the tiny man, himself, who would find
it.”</p>

<p>“But it was myself who found it and took it
away, when you were sound asleep in your bed,”
said her father.</p>

<p>Kathleen jumped up in surprise, but Mary Ellen
nodded her curly head, as if she knew all the time
that it was not the fairy.</p>

<p>“I saw Granny Connor’s red cloak bobbing across
the bog last night, as I stood at my bench mending
an old shoe,” her father continued, “and I watched
you stop under the oak tree to talk with her. When
I found the dish of stirabout under the hawthorn
bush I knew it was time for me to put an end to
these foolish notions about the good people, and tell
you the true words about Ireland’s brave men and
women. You should be learning about Brian Boru,
who drove the Danes out of Ireland, and Daniel
O’Connell, the greatest orator ever born on Irish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
soil. Those are the men for you to be thinking of,
instead of the leprecaun.”</p>

<p>Kathleen looked at him earnestly. “It’s not one
word I’m believin’ of all they say about you,
Father,” she said.</p>

<p>“It is what they say about the fairy people that’s
not for you to believe,” he answered, and rising
from the stone slab, he took a hand of each of the
children and led them across the top of the hill to
a grassy mound which was encircled by a ring of
jagged rocks.</p>

<p class="center">IN THE FAIRY RATH</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, Mary Ellen, it’s the fairy rath,” said Kathleen
under her breath, and she clasped her father’s
hand more tightly.</p>

<p>Grandmother Barry, who talked often in Gaelic
about the fairies with Great-grandmother Connell,
had told the children many times not to play too
near the fairy rath.</p>

<p>“There be many such mounds scattered over the
hills and glens of ould Ireland,” she said. “The
good people live in them and may do harm to
childer that make too bold with their haunts.”</p>

<p>“They must be bad people if they would do harm
to little Mary Ellen,” Kathleen replied.</p>

<p>“Hush, child!” her grandmother reproved her.
“They are like all men and women, liker to <i>do</i>
good if they be called good.”</p>

<p>Now, as they drew near the fairy rath, Kathleen
tiptoed over the rocky path, thinking every moment
to see a fairy slip behind a pebble or a blade of
grass. She felt sure that when they stepped within
the rocky ring, a door would open in the grassy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
mound and show to her eager eyes long rooms
glittering with jewelled walls, leading one after another
into the depths of the earth.</p>

<p>What was her surprise then, when they entered
the enclosure, to find, not a magic door leading to
fairyland but a single tiny room dug out of the
mound, sheltered from wind and rain by sods and
stones, with just room enough for a man to work
at his bench, and no more.</p>

<p>Her father pointed out to the child’s disappointed
eyes a leather pouch lying among the tools on the
work-bench.</p>

<p>“That is the only purse I’ve got, Kathleen,” he
said, “and my fingers have never seen the magic
day when they could fill it with silver.”</p>

<p>Poor Mary Ellen’s blind eyes could see nothing
of the shoemaker’s bench and the empty purse, but
her heart felt all the loving thought that moved
her sister to ask, “Then why did you not leave the
dish of stirabout under the hawthorn bush? The
little elf shoemaker sits there every night mending
his shoe, with his purse of gold beside him. Belike
you might snatch it yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Kathleen, it’s myself will be the only shoemaker
in these parts,” her father answered. “Put
the foolish fancies out of your head now. No good
ever came of such thoughts.”</p>

<p>It was not the first time he had told Kathleen to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
forget the fairy lore, and he had often checked
Grandmother Barry when her unruly tongue touched
upon the forbidden subject. “The childer’s heads
should not be filled with such nonsense,” he said.</p>

<p>But it was not easy to check Great-grandmother
Connell. She had lived ninety long years among a
fairy-loving people, and liked to tell the Gaelic
stories of old Ireland over and over again.</p>

<p>She it was who believed that Ireland was first
inhabited by a race of giants. “They lived here
with the birds and beasts before ever a man rode
through the green forests,” she told Grandmother
Barry.</p>

<p>“What became of them, then?” inquired her
daughter.</p>

<p>“Sure, they turned themselves into the wee folk
when men came here from over the seas, and they
live under the rocks and trees and in the fairy
mounds.”</p>

<p>“True it is,” agreed Grandmother Barry, and
she told Kathleen what the great-grandmother had
been saying in Gaelic about the giants and fairies.</p>

<p>That was how Kathleen came to know so many
of the tales of old Ireland, and why she was always
thinking of the wee folk.</p>

<p>“How can I put the thoughts out of my head?”
she asked her father. “Sure, the fairies are putting
them in again all the time, with their doings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“What are they doing, the day, to make you think
of them?” asked the shoemaker.</p>

<p>“There’s the ring of green grass beyond the
hawthorn bush,” she said timidly. “Danny borrowed
the plow from Farmer Flynn and plowed
through it over and over, but it came up again as
round and green as ever. What else could make
it but the fairies with their dancing feet?”</p>

<p>The shoemaker shook his head hopelessly at the
child’s simple faith in her old grandmother’s stories.
“It’s not like you, with your sense and handy ways
about the house, to believe the fairy nonsense,” he
said. “It must be because you have never learned
the reading. After this you must come up here
when your work in the house is done, and I’ll teach
you the words. If you don’t believe it from my
telling, you will from the books, that there are no
fairies in Ireland.”</p>

<p>So it came about that on sunny afternoons through
the winter two little girls played on the top of the
hill near a fairy rath in far Donegal, in the north
of Ireland. And often the shoemaker put his work
down on the bench and called the children to his
side, where he told them true stories of Irish history,
and taught Kathleen to read from the pages of an
old Irish book.</p>

</div>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the last words the two little girls clasped
hands and ran round and round the great stone
slab, not hearing their father’s voice calling to them
from his bench.</p>

<p>As the children dropped upon the stone he called
more sharply, “Kathleen! Do you hear me?”</p>

<p>“I hear you, but I do not fear you,” answered
Kathleen, leading Mary Ellen to her father’s side.
She put her arm around his neck and kissed his
patient face, then seated herself on his knee.</p>

<p>“I used to fear you,” she said with a laugh,
“after Granny Connor told me you had made a
bargain with the leprecaun, and that you had a
secret hiding-place.”</p>

<p>“And now it’s no secret at all, at all,” her father
said. “The grandmother has learned it, too, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
will be calling you down to run errands the minute
she lays eyes on you here.”</p>

<p>“We were both helping her, the morn,” said
Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>“What were you doing, jewel?” asked the father
of the little blind child.</p>

<p>“Oh, reddin’ up the house,” replied Mary Ellen.
“Kathleen swept the floor, and I wiped the dishes,
and then I held the yarn for Grandma Connell.
She is knitting you some stockings.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Kathleen, “and I drove the little
dun cow to the pasture beyond the bog; and on
my way home I pulled some rushes to make a new
brush for the hearth.”</p>

<p>“I helped Grandma Barry with the churning,
too,” said Mary Ellen. “We churned and churned,
but not a bit of butter did we get till Kathleen came
home and put a sod of burning peat under the
churn. Then the butter came soon enough, and
Kathleen said the good people had put a spell upon
the cream.”</p>

<p>“Faith, you’re always thinking of the fairies,”
exclaimed her father. “Do you like old Granny
Connor’s witch tales better than the stories I tell
you of brave Irish men, like Brian Boru and Conn
of the Hundred Battles?”</p>

<p>Kathleen looked at him quickly. “You tell us
that Conn lived many hundred years ago, and Brian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Boru has been dead these eight hundred years; but
Granny Connor says that the fairies are living now.
They have a council hall in a cave between here
and Letterkenny. The cave is under the great Rock
of Doon, and—”</p>

<p>“I like not to hear you speak so much of old
Granny Connor and her tales,” her father interrupted
her. “It’s her and her red cloak have put
sorrow and shame on me these many years.</p>

<p>“Do you mind how green the grass is already,
down there in front of the door, Kathleen, child?”
he added.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “I’m fond of the feeling of
it to my bare feet.”</p>

<p>“You might travel over the whole of Donegal
without seeing another yard so green,” he said
sadly, “and it’s a shame to me to have it so.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Mary Ellen, who thought the soft
grass the best playground in the whole world.</p>

<p>“Because no stranger ever stops before our door
to beg a bite or a night’s shelter from us,” he replied.</p>

<p>“True it is,” said the child, “but Grandma Barry
says it is lonely here and no one cares to come.”</p>

<p>“I mind it is because Granny Connor put the
curse upon me years ago, when first I came here,”
her father repeated. “She said, ‘May the grass be
always green before your door,’ and green it has
been ever since.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>

<p>“But why should that be a curse?” asked
Kathleen.</p>

<p>“Because Ireland is the kindest country under
the sun,” he answered. “Open house and open
heart is our motto, and if a yard is green, ’tis because
no friendly foot has worn it bare.”</p>

<p>Kathleen’s cheeks flushed. “Danny and I will
dig up every blade of grass before we sleep the
night,” she declared.</p>

<p>“Whist,” said her father. “It is as it is. But
it might have been different if I had said the kind
word to the old woman in red when I brought your
mother to these parts years gone.”</p>

<p>“What did she do?” asked Mary Ellen, taking
her father’s big hand in her two little ones and
holding it fast.</p>

<p>“We were just after lighting the first sod of peat
on the hearth, when Granny Connor stood at the
door, dressed all in her red cloak, and so still that
no one had heard her step. ‘’Tis a haunted country
that you’ve come to,’ she said, and it frightened
your mother to hear her.</p>

<p>“There were the three of you children, and Mary
Ellen but a wee baby. Your mother was ailing,
and I was angered at the old woman’s tongue. ‘Be
off with your crazy talk!’ I said, seeing that your
mother was scared, and Granny went away across
the bog, but first she said the curse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have bided here after that,” said
Kathleen, but her father shook his head.</p>

<p>“I had worked a long time to build the little
cottage and get it dry-thatched,” he said, “and I
had a fine flock of sheep to pasture on the hillside.
But the mother was lonely and fearsome after
Granny Connor’s visit, and she pined away and
died.”</p>

<p>The children nestled closer to his side to comfort
him, and he put a hand on each little head,—Kathleen’s
dark and straight-haired, Mary Ellen’s yellow
and curly.</p>

<p>“Then I sent into County Sligo for your two
grandmothers to come and bide,” he went on, “and
soon I had to do something else to earn a living,
because the sheep fell sick and died in the pasture.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?” questioned Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>“I went over the mountains a-tinkering,” replied
her father. “But your mother used to say that bad
luck follows those that have no steady biding-place,
and so it was for me. Wherever I went there was
a whisper that I was like to have trouble for company,
and faith, in those days he seemed my best
friend.”</p>

<p>“Grandma Barry says to look trouble in the eye
and he’ll turn away,” said Kathleen.</p>

<p>“Sure I’ve seen no more of him since Danny
got big enough to lend a hand,” said her father.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
“Danny’s the good lad and will do a hand’s turn
of work with the best of them.”</p>

<p>“’Tis Danny that keeps the house dry-thatched,”
said Kathleen, looking down at the brown-thatched,
white-walled cottage at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>“’Tis Kathleen that reds up the house and helps
the two grandmothers,” suggested Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>“She’s a fine slip of a girl,” replied her father
heartily, “and you too, Molly jewel; there’s a pair
of ye.”</p>

<p class="center">ERIN’S HARP</p>


<p><span class="smcap">March</span> winds blew across the valley and ruffled
Mary Ellen’s yellow curls as she sat in the ring of
green grass made by the fairies’ dancing feet, and
played with some sea-shells and pebbles Danny had
found in the seaweed he gathered for Farmer Flynn.</p>

<p>She had been playing contentedly for a long time
when she suddenly jumped up, scattering a handful
of pebbles from her lap. “Kathleen,” she called,
“I hear the peddler’s cart. Sure, he’s comin’
across the bridge this minute.”</p>

<p>Kathleen rushed out of the house, clasped her
sister’s hand tightly in her own, and ran up the
little path to the top of the hill as fast as she
could go.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary Ellen!” she panted; “I made sure
I’d finish the stockings before the peddler came this
way again; but here he is now and only one done.
The blue dress will be worn out before the other
stocking’s finished.”</p>

<p>The peddler drew up his cart before the door of
the little cottage, and Grandmother Barry went out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
to bargain with him for a piece of linen in exchange
for her butter and eggs. Great-grandmother
Connell hobbled out to see that the bargain was well
made, and the three laughed heartily over Kathleen’s
hurried flight.</p>

<p>In the winter the peddler had given the child a
piece of blue homespun for a dress, and she had
promised to knit a pair of stockings for him in
payment; but there were so many more interesting
things to do every day that the knitting proved slow
work, and Kathleen had often wished the blue dress
back in the peddler’s cart.</p>

<p>“Faith, Kathleen makes it harder work to keep
out of my sight than to do the knitting,” the peddler
said, as he opened his cart and took out the linen.</p>

<p>Grandmother Barry laughed as she answered,
“I’m thinkin’ it will teach the child a good lesson.
It’s best to keep well out of debt, and a dress is
better paid for before it is worn. But she shall
finish the stockings this day week, or I’ll knit them
myself.”</p>

<p>She went into the house to fetch her butter and
eggs, and after much weighing and measuring and
talking, they were exchanged for a piece of coarse
linen and a pound of good honey.</p>

<p>In the meantime the two little girls hid behind
the fairy rath and whispered together about the
stockings.</p>

</div>
<p class="p2"></p>

<p>“The minute the peddler drives down the road
I’ll go and get the knitting, and I’ll keep the
needles clickin’ while I’m out of my bed till it’s
done,” Kathleen declared.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen held up her hand. “Whist, alanna,”
she said softly, “’tis fairy music I hear.”</p>

<p>Kathleen listened eagerly for a moment. “True
for you,” she said. “I hear it myself. Belike it’s
the sea-gods over at Horn Head. There was a big
storm last night, and Grandmother Barry says that
after a big storm thousands of the sea-gods ride
over the waves on their white-maned steeds winding
their battle horns.”</p>

<p>It is ten miles across the country to Horn Head,
which is one of the rocky headlands on the north
coast of Ireland, where the waves of the Atlantic
Ocean beat against the dark cliffs. Highland lakes
and mountain rivers lie between, and the road over
which Danny brought the seaweed for Farmer Flynn
leads across purple hills that would surely deaden
the sound of surf miles away.</p>

<p>“It’s nearer than Horn Head,” said Mary Ellen.
“There may be fairies in the rath after all.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and see,” Kathleen suggested, and the
two children tiptoed carefully around the circle of
rocks, forgetting all about the peddler, and the
stockings, and Kathleen’s good resolution.</p>

<p>As they crept softly up to the open door of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
grassy mound the sweet notes became a little tune,
and a voice began singing the familiar words of an
old Irish song.</p>

<p>Kathleen stood still, hardly daring to breathe, but
Mary Ellen stepped boldly into the tiny room.
“It’s the father himself,” she said, and Kathleen
followed her sister, astonished indeed to find her
father sitting on his work-bench and gently touching
the strings of a small harp.</p>

<p>“I’m glad it wasn’t the fairy music we heard,”
she said, after the surprise was over. “Grandma
Barry says a spell is cast over him that hears it, and
after the spell is taken off he pines away and dies
in a year and a day.”</p>

<p>“Is it your own harp, Father?” asked Mary
Ellen, thinking he might perhaps have borrowed it
from the fairies.</p>

<p>“It was your mother’s,” he answered. “It was in
her family from the days of the old Irish chiefs, and
she showed me how to pick the strings.”</p>

<p>Mary Ellen touched it softly with her fingers.
“It almost seems alive,” she said, as the strings
gave out their sweet sounds.</p>

<p>“There was once a god in Ireland who owned a
harp that was alive,” her father said with a smile.
“He used to be called the ‘Mighty Father of Ireland,’
and his harp could do strange things when it
had a mind. Sometimes he would go to the top<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
of the mountain and play the whole procession of
the seasons—spring, summer, autumn, winter—out
of the strings of the harp.</p>

<p>“Once the god was captured by the giants, and
was taken away to their castle, but he called to his
harp for help, and it heard and answered. It flew
through the air straight to its master, and killed
nine of the giants as it flew.”</p>

<p>“Listen to him, telling us tales of the giants,”
whispered Kathleen, but Mary Ellen was thinking
of the harp and paid no attention to her sister.</p>

<p>“Danny says there is a harp on the green flag
of Ireland,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said her father, “it was an Irish god
who made the harp and played upon its strings.”</p>

<p>“Tell us about it,” begged Kathleen, who loved
the gods and giants as well as she did the fairies.</p>

<p>“The god’s name was Dagda,” her father told
her, “and once when he was walking beside a blue
lake he saw a beautiful maiden and wished to have
her for his wife. But the maiden feared him and
ran away through the forest.</p>

<p>“Dagda followed her and she went on running
away; and so at last they came to a beautiful curving
beach, with the waves washing the yellow sands.</p>

<p>“As the maiden fled swiftly across the wet sands
she heard a strange, mournful sound, and stopped
to listen to the music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span></p>

<p>“The bones of a fish lay on the sand at her feet,
and the dry skin, stretched from rib to rib, made a
harp for the wind to play upon.</p>

<p>“When Dagda saw that the sweet sounds pleased
the maiden, he took a piece of wood and made a
harp after the same pattern, playing upon the strings
with his fingers as the wind had taught him to do.
After that the maiden followed him gladly for love
of the music.</p>

<p>“It was the first music ever heard in all Ireland,
but since that day we have had harpers from one
end of the land to the other. ’Tis a wonderful
country for music, and we put the harp on our
green flag to show that we’re proud of the sweet
songs of Erin.”</p>

<p>Kathleen sighed when the story was finished. “I
wish it were the days of gods and giants and beautiful
maidens now,” she said.</p>

<p>“I’d wish for the days of the harpers and story-tellers,”
said Mary Ellen wistfully.</p>

<p>“Right you are, Molly jewel,” said her father,
putting the harp carefully away in its case. “The
giants were just plain men like myself, but with no
learning at all, at all. Faith, they could neither read
nor write, and but for the harpers we’d know
nothing about them.”</p>

<p>“How do we know from the harpers?” asked
Kathleen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p>“Sure, the harpers and story-tellers made up
grand songs and stories about the gods and the
giants of old Ireland, and travelled up and down
the length and breadth of the land singing their
songs and telling their stories wherever they went.
It was the only way of learning that people had in
the days when there were no books.”</p>

<p>“The people must have been glad to see the
harpers coming,” said Mary Ellen, thinking how
much she would like to hear their songs.</p>

<p>“That they were,” replied her father. “Even the
kings made them welcome, and gave great feasts
in their honor. The feasts were held in a long banquet
hall with rows of tables up and down the sides,
and there were sometimes more than a hundred men
at the tables. The king sat at the head of the hall,
with a harper on one side and a story-teller on the
other, and there was merry-making through half the
night.”</p>

<p>“Those old kings of Ireland must have been
great men,” said Kathleen.</p>

<p>“That they were,” replied her father, “and Brian
Boru was the best of them all.”</p>

<p>“The grandmother is callin’,” interrupted Mary
Ellen. “I hear the sound of her bell.”</p>

<p>“She’s always callin’,” Kathleen complained, but
she took her sister’s hand and hurried obediently
down the hill.</p>

<p class="center">THE LITTLE GREEN SHAMROCK</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Look</span>, Kathleen,” said Grandmother Barry, as the
two children reached the cottage door, “there’s
not another sod of peat in the house. Run down
to Farmer Flynn’s to meet Danny, and tell him to
bring some home with him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get the small creel Danny made for me,
and bring some home myself,” said Kathleen, running
into the cottage.</p>

<p>She was out again in a moment with two light
wicker baskets. “Here’s your creel, too, Mary
Ellen,” she said, and hung it carefully over her
sister’s shoulders.</p>

<p>Farmer Flynn lived a mile away on a big sheep
farm, and Kathleen was glad to be sent there for
peat. She liked the work and bustle of the farm
life and always saw something new and interesting.
Sometimes there were baby lambs in the sheepfold,
sometimes she saw a calf or a pair of young donkeys,
and then, best of all, there was the big flock
of white geese that belonged to the farmer’s wife.</p>

<p>Kathleen loved to watch the geese, and she often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
told Mary Ellen funny stories about them and their
strange ways. “I’m going to ask Mrs. Flynn to
let me tend them for her next summer,” she had
confided to her sister. “That will be one way to earn
pennies for your eyes, darlin’.”</p>

<p>Danny had worked for the farmer ever since
the winter his father had brought them all to live
in Donegal. He had been a pale, shy little lad at
first, but now he was grown strong and sturdy,
“able to do a day’s work with the best of them,”
he said proudly.</p>

<p>Farmer Flynn was proud of him, too, and often
said, “I made of Dan Barry the man that he is.
He can thatch a roof or shear a sheep to-day as
well as I can myself.”</p>

<p>And whenever little Kathleen caught the farmer’s
eye she would stand straighter to hear him say,
“There’s a fine slip of a lass. She’ll be a good
woman and a pride to you, Danny my boy.”</p>

<p>The two children, with their creels on their backs,
ran down the little lane behind the house, followed
the brook which chattered over the rocks at the foot
of the heather glen, crossed the bog and climbed
the hill, and then, at a quick turn of the path,
there they were at the peat-shed, and there was
Danny standing at the door.</p>

<p>He was talking with a strange man who carried
a bundle of blackthorn sticks on his back; but just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
as the little girls came around the corner Danny
shook his head and turned to go into the shed.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary Ellen,” said Kathleen, “there’s a
peddler and he’s trying to sell Danny a shillalah.”</p>

<p>“He’ll not do it,” said Mary Ellen. “Sure,
Danny’s saving every odd shilling he earns. He
has them in an old stocking, and he shook them out
and let me count them. He has near a pound.”</p>

<p>“The peddler has a bundle of fine big sticks,”
said Kathleen, “but not one of them is as thick
and strong as the blackthorn Father has from Great-grandfather
Connell. I’m thinkin’ Danny will have
that some day.”</p>

<p>The peddler smiled pleasantly at the two little
girls as they drew nearer, and put his hand so
gently on Mary Ellen’s curly head that Kathleen
took a liking to him at once.</p>

<p>“Where’s your bit of green ribbon?” he asked
with a laugh, looking at the blue homespun dresses
as if he thought they ought to be trimmed with
green.</p>

<p>Kathleen looked up into her brother’s face to
see if he knew what the stranger meant by the
question.</p>

<p>Before Danny could tell her the peddler added,
“Mayhap you never heard of our good St. Patrick
in these parts,” and he laughed again as if he
thought this question a better joke than the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span></p>

<p>“We know St. Patrick well,” said Kathleen.
“It’s not more than a day’s journey from here to
his mountain in County Mayo, where he drove all
the snakes out of Ireland into the sea.”</p>

<p>“Then you should be wearing the green for him
this day,” said the peddler, and he showed proudly
a big knot of green ribbon on one of the black-thorn
sticks he carried, and a smaller knot on his
worn coat. “Tell the truth now, that you clean
forgot this is the seventeenth of March and St.
Patrick’s Day in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Go away with you!” exclaimed Danny.
“Where are your eyes, man? Don’t you see the
green in my cap?”</p>

<p>Ireland is often called the Emerald Isle because
of its setting of green fields and hills, and the
national color, which is green, is seen everywhere.
The English flag floats over the public buildings,
but on holidays and feast-days the green flag of
Erin decorates the houses, and on St. Patrick’s Day
every one wears a bit of green in memory of the
patron saint, and in honor of Ireland.</p>

<p>Danny, who had no green ribbon to wear to show
his love for his country, had tucked a sprig of green
shamrock into his cap, but now the tender leaves
were wilted and hung drooping from their slender
stems.</p>

<p>“It’s St. Patrick’s own little plant, and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
fresh and green enough when I found it beside the
brook this morning,” he said, taking off his cap
and touching the withered leaves tenderly as if he
loved them.</p>

<p>“Come home with us now,” he added, turning to
the peddler, “and we’ll give you a good Irish welcome
and a bite and a sup.”</p>

<p>“I’ll gladly go with you and the childer here,”
said the peddler heartily. So he helped the little
girls fill their creels with the sods of dry peat and
fastened a bit of shamrock on their dresses “for
St. Patrick and old Ireland.” Danny finished up his
work in a hurry, and soon they were all on their
way back along the lonely path. But it was lonely
no longer, for they sang as they marched along:</p>

<p class="center">GOOD ST. PATRICK</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother Barry</span> heard the song, and went to
the door to see who was singing it so heartily.
When she saw the peddler with the children she
hurried to put an extra bowl and plate on the table,
and bustled about the room setting out the simple
meal.</p>

<p>The potatoes were baking in the embers, the
kettle was boiling cheerfully over the burning peat,
and a big dish of oaten stirabout was already steaming
on the table.</p>

<p>“I’ll make a good cup of tay, and well have
a supper fit for the king,” Grandmother Barry said
aloud to herself, as she measured out the tea carefully
and poured the boiling water over it. Then
she went again to the door to give the stranger a
hearty welcome.</p>

<p>Kathleen rang the bell to call her father down
from his work-bench, Danny milked the little cow,
and “in just no time at all” they were ready for
supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<p>“’Tis a sin and a shame that Kathleen is not
wearing her green dress for St. Patrick,” said
Grandmother Barry, as she saw the knot of green
ribbon in the peddler’s coat. “I put it on her to
wear to Mass, but ’tis her best and not to be worn
common when she’s here at home. ’Twas a grand
morning, and Father Burke gave the children a
good talk about St. Patrick.”</p>

<p>“A fine morning it was, woman dear,” said the
peddler, “and a grand day for the best saint that
ever lived in ould Ireland.</p>

<p>“Tell us what Father Burke said about him,”
he added, turning to Kathleen.</p>

<p>Poor Kathleen flushed and hung her head.
“Sure, I know he stood on Croagh Patrick, over
in County Mayo, and drove all the snakes out of
the whole country into the sea,” she said, wishing
she could remember some of the stories the good
priest had told them.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about that,” said the peddler;
“but it is true that there is not one to be found
in the whole island. Some say there was never a
snake here, and some say the good saint drove them
all out with one stroke of his big stick. However
it is, he is the best saint that ever lived, and a glory
to Ireland, praise be to him!”</p>

<p>“Father Burke says he was only a lad when he
was stolen away from his father and mother in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
Scotland, and brought to Ireland to tend swine for
one of the chiefs,” said Mary Ellen shyly.</p>

<p>“He was sixteen years old, and as straight and
handsome a lad as ever lived,” said the peddler.</p>

<p>“Was he a saint then?” asked Kathleen.</p>

<p>“Whist, child,” exclaimed Grandmother Barry,
“would a saint tend wild pigs on the mountains
for any man, chief or no chief?”</p>

<p>“He was a brave lad,” repeated the peddler.
“It should be told oftener how he served one of
the chiefs for six long years, and served him well.
He set a good example to the flighty gossoons
nowadays that can’t stick to one thing for as long
as a month at a time.”</p>

<p>“Danny has worked for Farmer Flynn ten years,”
said Mary Ellen, fearing the peddler might think
her brother a “flighty gossoon.”</p>

<p>“Father Burke said that St. Patrick went all over
Ireland, ringing his bell and preaching to the people,”
said Kathleen, beginning to remember some
of the story.</p>

<p>“So he did; he was a wonderful preacher,” said
Grandmother Barry, “and he was Bishop of all
Ireland for many years.”</p>

<p>“Was that when Great-grandmother Connell was
a little girl?” asked Mary Ellen, who thought her
great-grandmother very old.</p>

<p>“Whist, jewel; it was nearly fifteen hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
years ago that St. Patrick died,” her father told
her, “and your great-grandmother’s only ninety.”</p>

<p>“Tell us the story of St. Patrick,” begged Kathleen.
“I’ll remember it this time, for sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, now,” the peddler began, “when Patrick
was a lad of sixteen he was brought to Ireland
and sold as a slave to one of the rich chiefs, who
sent him to tend swine on the mountains. At first
he was no doubt sad and lonely, but he bore his
troubles bravely and thought often of the good
Father in Heaven.”</p>

<p>Kathleen’s father rose quickly, and going to a
box in the corner of the room, he took out a book
and brought it back to the fire.</p>

<p>“This is what the good saint himself wrote about
those lonely days in the mountains,” he said, and
turning the page he began to read slowly: “I was
daily employed tending flocks; and I prayed frequently
during the day, and the love of God was
more and more enkindled in my heart, my fear and
faith were increased, and my spirit was stirred;
so much so that in a single day I poured out my
prayers a hundred times and nearly as often in the
night. Nay, even in the woods and mountains I
remained, and rose before the dawn to my prayer,
in frost and snow and rain; neither did I suffer
any injury from it; for the spirit of the Lord was
fervent within me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span></p>

<p>“He was a good lad,” said Grandmother Barry,
wiping a tear from her wrinkled cheek, and taking
up her knitting again.</p>

<p>“That he was, praise be to him,” the peddler
agreed. “He tended the swine for six years, and
then he escaped and made his way back to his home
in Scotland; but he could not forget the Irish
people and he longed to go back and teach them to
be Christians. He studied for many years in France
and other countries, but all the time his thoughts
turned back to Ireland and he had dreams and
visions about it.</p>

<p>“At last the Pope gave his permission, and
Patrick set out for Ireland, landing on the north
coast, in what is now County Down. Dicho, the
chief of the district, thought that Patrick and his
companions were pirates, and went to meet them
and drive them out of the country; but when he
saw their calm and peaceful ways he saluted them
and invited them to his castle.</p>

<p>“Here Patrick told the chief his story and explained
his belief in God, and Dicho and his whole
family became Christians and were baptized.”</p>

<p>“He was a wonderful preacher,” repeated Grandmother
Barry, with a nod of her head.</p>

<p>“Father Burke says that no missionary, since the
time of the apostles, ever preached the gospel with
more success than St. Patrick,” said Danny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>

<p>“That was because he cared nothing for riches
and honor,” said the peddler. “He loved the people
of Ireland and longed to make them all good
Christians.</p>

<p>“After living with Dicho for some time and converting
all the people roundabout, he bade good-bye
to his friends and sailed down to the mouth of the
river Boyne. From there he walked to the Hill
of Tara, where the high-king of all Ireland lived
in a great palace.</p>

<p>“He arrived at the palace on Easter morning,
and presented himself before the king and his court.
Patrick was robed in white, as were also his companions,
and he wore his mitre and carried his
crosier in his hand. He converted many of the
king’s followers, and preached to the people throughout
all the king’s dominions.</p>

<p>“’Twas so all over Ireland,—wherever Patrick
went he turned pagans to Christians and built
churches.</p>

<p>“He died in the very place where he first
preached to Dicho, on the seventeenth day of March,
about the year 465.”</p>

<p>“Is that why we call the seventeenth of March
St. Patrick’s Day?” asked Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied her father, “it is the day that
he died. We don’t rightly know just what day he
was born.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span></p>

<p>“How do you know so many things about St.
Patrick, then, if he lived so many hundred years
ago?” asked Kathleen.</p>

<p>“The old books tell us,” her father said. “Patrick,
himself, wrote about his wanderings, and the
monks copied these books and many others, painting
pictures on the pages to illustrate them. It is from
these ancient Gaelic books that we learn much about
the life and customs of the people.”</p>

<p>“There were books of laws for the kings and
the people, too,” said the peddler.</p>

<p>“Did the kings have to obey laws?” asked Kathleen,
who supposed kings did just as they chose.</p>

<p>“That they did,” replied the peddler. “There
was a law that no man could rule at Tara who was
not perfect in his looks; so when Cormac mac Art
lost an eye he had to give up being king.”</p>

<p>“’Twas a shame, too, for he was a good king,”
said the father.</p>

<p>“It was also against the law for the sun to rise
while the king was lying in bed at Tara,” said the
peddler.</p>

<p>The children laughed merrily, and Danny asked,
“How could they keep the sun from rising till the
king was out of his bed?”</p>

<p>“Faith, they made the king get up before the
sun did,” the peddler answered.</p>

<p>While the children were laughing over his joke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Grandmother Barry put down her knitting and went
to the cupboard for a plate of oat-cakes and her
precious pound of honey.</p>

<p>Everyone was quiet for a few minutes over the
feast, and little Mary Ellen was the first to break
the silence. “Father told us a story about St.
Columbkille one day,” she said. “He was born
here in our own Donegal and he had little cakes
baked for him with the letters of the alphabet on
them. I’m thinkin’ if I had cakes like that I could
learn the letters with my fingers.”</p>

<p>“Faith, he must have had a fine time picnicking
on his letters,” said the peddler.</p>

<p>“There was St. Bridget, too,” said Grandmother
Barry; “she was a fine woman and took great pride
in learning and teaching. And I doubt not her
fingers had magic in them to turn wool into yarn
and yarn into stockings, like any colleen of Donegal,”
she added, with a look at Kathleen.</p>

<p>But Kathleen was sound asleep in her chair and
had forgotten all about the stocking she was going
to finish knitting that very day.</p>

<p>“The child is tired out with our stories,” said
her father.</p>

<p>“I mind we should all be in our beds,” said
Grandmother Barry, and soon they were tucked
away comfortably for the night.</p>

<p class="center">A RIDE WITH THE POSTMAN</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">My blessing go with you wherever you go.”</div>

</div>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Mary Ellen’s sweet Irish way of saying
good-bye to the peddler when he went away the
next day; and he replied heartily, “If I should
travel over the whole of Ireland between sun-up
and sun-down, I’d hear no better word.”</p>

<p>At the cross-roads he met the postman in his
red jaunting-car, riding toward the thatched cottage
at the foot of the hill, and he stopped to pass
the time of day with him.</p>

<p>“Give the two little girls a ride,” said the peddler.
“If ’tis to the National School you are going,
with a letter for the teacher, this way is as short
as the other, and ’tis a lonely life the two children
lead,—a mile from any other house, and never
another child to play with.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a letter for Jerry, himself, that I have,
and ’twill take me by the cottage, anyway,” answered
the postman; and looked the letter over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
thinking that it was probably from Grandmother
Barry’s daughter, Hannah Malone, as the postmark
was “Kilkenny.”</p>

<p>He found the great-grandmother crooning an old
Gaelic milking tune over her wheel, instead of the
spinning song which she usually sang; and Grandmother
Barry greeted him with, “Ah, Larry O’Day,
this is just such a morning as the one when you and
I went with the rest on the pilgrimage to ‘Tobar
N’alt,’ the holy well in County Sligo, to cure us
of our rheumatism.”</p>

<p>The postman laughed. “That was forty years
ago, and I’d forgot all about it,” he said, throwing
out a letter from the pack. “It’s a dozen pilgrimages
to holy wells that I’ve made since then,” he
went on, “and there’s not a heartier man for his
age, than myself, in all Ireland.”</p>

<p>Then he called to the children and asked if they
cared to ride with him as far as the National School,
four miles back of the hill, to carry a letter to the
teacher.</p>

<p>“Oh, Molly darlin’, a ride!” gasped Kathleen,
hardly believing her ears; while Mary Ellen was so
excited that she climbed over the seat and would
have tumbled into the well of the jaunting-car if
Kathleen had not held her back.</p>

<p>“Steady, there, steady!” said Larry O’Day.
“There be all sorts of wells in holy Ireland, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
the blessed ones filled with the water that cures
all ailments, to the empty one between the seats of a
jaunting-car; but not a one is there built to hold
little girls in red dresses.”</p>

<p>Both children laughed merrily, and held tight to
each other as the old horse jogged up hill and down
dale toward the far-away schoolhouse.</p>

<p>The blue waters of a lake glistened afar off
among the heather, and the postman said, “I mind
me that somewhere in these parts there is a long
flat stone that marks the place where the good Saint
Columba was born. I’ve heard that if a body sleeps
on it for one night before leaving dear old Ireland,
he’ll never be homesick.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps ’tis the same flat stone by Father’s
bench, where we play betimes,” said Kathleen.
“I’ll tell Danny about it. He’s thinking of going
to find his fortune in America.”</p>

<p>Then the children asked about the schoolhouse
and the children who went to school in it. “How
old are they?” asked Kathleen. “Are there any
as little as Mary Ellen?”</p>

<p>“There are some smaller than Mary Ellen and
some bigger than you,” answered the postman.
“There are both boys and girls.”</p>

<p>“What do they learn?” she asked again, while
Mary Ellen asked, “What do they play?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen them playing some kind of a game<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
where they hold hands in a circle,” he told Mary
Ellen, and both little girls cried at once, “That’s
‘Green grow the rushes-o.’”</p>

<p>“Belike it is,” he said cheerfully, and went on,
“they learn reading, and writing, and the church
catechism.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they learn about the grand places there
are in the other parts of the world?” asked Kathleen
wistfully. One of her few great pleasures was
to get out an old geography-book belonging to her
father, and study the pictures in it.</p>

<p>“Perhaps there’s something of the sort for the
older ones,” said the postman, “but if a body can’t
travel the world over, to see such places, I’m doubtful
if there’s any good in learning about them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” cried Kathleen, aghast at such
a thought; while Mary Ellen said softly, “If I
could see just one little green shamrock, I’d walk
to the end of the world.”</p>

<p>Then they turned into another road and saw the
children playing in the school-yard, and a sudden
shyness fell upon Kathleen at the sight of so many
children.</p>

<p>After the teacher had taken her letter and the red
cart was jogging back over the road, there was no
end to the questions Larry O’Day had to answer.</p>

<p>“Would those little girls feed the chickens and
pigs, and drive the cow to pasture, as Kathleen did?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>Would the boys plant potatoes and work in the bog
just the same as Danny? Was that the very school
where Danny himself walked eight miles a day,
one winter, to learn to figure?”</p>

<p>Before they reached the thatched cottage again,
the postman had talked more than he had for many
a day before, and Kathleen helped her little sister
down from the car in a great hurry to run to
Grandmother Barry and ask still other questions.</p>

<p>But Grandmother Barry had questions of her
own to ask. “Sure, Kathleen alanna,” she began,
“and how would you like to go down to Kilkenny
and live with your Aunt Hannah?”</p>

<p>“When?” asked Kathleen breathlessly.</p>

<p>“As soon as the plans can be made,” answered
her grandmother. “Your Aunt Hannah has sent
the word in the letter the postman left; and your
father has gone to fetch Danny and talk it over
with him.”</p>

<p>“There they are now,” said Mary Ellen, her
quick ear catching the sound of their footsteps, and
the next moment Danny and his father were turning
into the yard.</p>

<p>Then Mary Ellen held the wonderful letter while
Kathleen looked it over and Father Jerry told what
it said.</p>

<p>“Himself has been doing well in his business,
praise be!” Aunt Hannah wrote, “and I’d like to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
do something for a child of my youngest brother,
though he did take up with the tinker’s trade
against my wishes; and him with the schooling.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said the shoemaker, looking up
at the circle of faces. “Hannah begged me to take
up teaching for a living. I had the learning for it,
and it is an honorable calling in Ireland, and always
has been. But I longed to see the whole of the
green island, so I took on a trade that gave me a
chance to travel over it.”</p>

<p>“’Tis of the chair in the chimney-corner at
Barney’s house in Sligo, I’ve been thinking all the
morn,” said Great-grandmother Connell. “Do you
believe Barney has kept it waiting for me these ten
years as he said he would?”</p>

<p>“I doubt not there’s a chair each side of the
chimney, one for you and one for Mother Barry,”
said Father Jerry gently.</p>

<p>“’Tis Ireland that never forgets the old mother,”
said the older woman, “and my heart is crying out
for the dear old home where I lived for eighty
years.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t we all go?” asked Danny boldly.
“I’ve money enough for my passage to America,
and I’d like to try my fortune in the world.”</p>

<p>“But what will become of me?” asked little Mary
Ellen.</p>

<p>“’Tis you and I will buy a great dog to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
us company, and we’ll go travelling together up
north to listen to the waves beating around the
Giant’s Causeway, Molly darling,” her father told
her.</p>

<p>But Danny had to give a month’s warning to
Farmer Flynn, and before the time was up, a letter
had reached them from Tonroe. It said that Cousin
Bee, Uncle Barney’s daughter who had married a
Donovan, would be glad to have Mary Ellen bide
with her for a while, at her home in Roscommon
County.</p>

<p>“So you and the doggie must travel alone to
the North,” whispered Mary Ellen to her father.</p>

<p>And that was the way of it.</p>

<p class="center">COUSIN BEE’S FARM IN TONROE</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was an April morning at Cousin Bee’s little
farm-house in Tonroe. The kettle was bubbling
cheerfully over the burning peat in the fireplace;
the cement floor of the kitchen was spotlessly clean;
and Patrick, Bee’s husband, was making the children
feel quite at home as he talked with them
about Donegal and laughed heartily over their little
stories.</p>

<p>Danny, Kathleen and Mary Ellen had arrived at
the station with the two grandmothers the night
before, and nothing would do but they must all
leave the train together.</p>

<p>“Sure, we’ve room and to spare for a strong
lad like you,” Patrick had told Danny; and Bee had
said, “’Twould be a shame for Mary Ellen and
Kathleen to be separated so sudden-like.”</p>

<p>So Uncle Barney took the two grandmothers home
with him to Killaraght, while Danny and Kathleen
went with Mary Ellen to visit Cousin Bee before
going on with their journey,—Kathleen to Kilkenny,
and Danny to Queenstown, where he was
to take the steamer for America.</p>

<p class="caption"><a href="#Page_47"><i> Page 47</i></a></p>
</div>
<p class="p2"></p>

<p>Their first morning in Tonroe opened bright and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
cheery, outside as well as in, and Kathleen was so
excited over all the new sights that she could
hardly wait to eat her breakfast. Of course everything
had to be described to Mary Ellen, and
Patrick’s hearty laugh filled the kitchen when
Kathleen told her sister that the village looked as if
a giant had taken a great creel filled with houses,
and dropped them from a high ladder to the plain
below.</p>

<p>“Kathleen never saw so many houses together
before, till she went to Letterkenny yesterday to
take the train away from Donegal,” Danny
explained.</p>

<p>“Then she’ll like to ride over to Boyle with Bee
on market days,” said Patrick kindly; “there’s
houses a-plenty there. But the plains of Boyle will
look flat enough to her after the mountains of her
own county.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary Ellen, come here!” cried Kathleen,
who had gone to the back door for another look
at the village. “There’s a church steeple far away
beyond a hilleen, and there’s the fine National School
building that Grandma Barry used to tell us about.
It’s on the little hill, and I can see it every time I
look out at the door. But the mountains are far
away. There’s not one to be seen near by.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they have put on a cloak of darkness,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
suggested Mary Ellen. “Is there nothing at all
where the mountains rightly belong?”</p>

<p>“It’s better than mountains,” said Kathleen decidedly,
to Patrick’s delight. “There’s another
hilleen of trees just beyond the hedge, and it looks
like a picnic garden, for the trees are all covered
with creels and creels of pink and white blossoms.”</p>

<p>“She means the rath, and the hawthorn trees,”
exclaimed Patrick.</p>

<p>“It is an old fort, darlin’,” Bee explained, “and
it was built by a great chief hundreds of years ago;
but it looks like a little hill now. There’s another
just forninst the church steeple; and one off to the
side of the house that you’d best not go too near.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Kathleen curiously.</p>

<p>“An old chief was buried there hundreds of years
ago,” answered Bee, “and now the fairies live in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary Ellen,” whispered Kathleen, “there
are fairies here after all, and we were thinkin’ we
had left them behind us in Donegal.”</p>

<p>Then she said aloud to Cousin Bee, “It would be
a fine place for the fairies to dance under the pink
and white trees in the rath beyond the garden. Did
the old chiefs have their picnics there?”</p>

<p>“Whist, jewel, the Irish chiefs had other things
to do,” said her cousin. “They had to be fighting
with other chiefs, and killing the wild beasts; and
sometimes they went off hunting foxes and deer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
through the green forests, but I’m thinking they
had no time for picnics.”</p>

<p>Mary Ellen was standing by Kathleen’s side, her
sightless eyes looking beyond the green hedge
toward the beautiful mound of trees that scented
the air with thousands of blossoms.</p>

<p>“What did the chiefs do with the forts?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“They lived in them,” answered Bee. “First
they built a great circular wall of earth or stone to
keep out wild beasts and robbers; and then inside
the wall they built their house. Sometimes there
were two or three walls, one outside the other. The
forts were called raths, and if a king lived in them
his house was called a dun.”</p>

<p>“That rath looks like a grove of trees now,” said
Kathleen.</p>

<p>“The trees have grown up on the walls, and the
houses are all gone hundreds of years ago,” Bee
replied.</p>

<p>“What did the houses look like?” asked Mary
Ellen.</p>

<p>“The darlin’! she wants to know how it all
looked just as if she had the sight,” said Bee, putting
her arm around the child.</p>

<p>“Well,” she went on, “the houses were shaped
like bee-hives. They were built of poles all woven
in and out with twigs, like wicker baskets, so the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
books say. Many a town in Ireland to-day is built
where a chief’s rath or a king’s dun once stood, and
it gets its name by that token. There’s Dundalk
and Dunglow and Dunmore, Rathmelton, Rathdrum
and Rathcormack. There are duns and raths all
over the country.”</p>

<p>“There are ‘Kils,’ too,” said Mary Ellen.
“Kathleen found them in our old geography, and
Father made a little verse about them. He says
that ‘Kil’ means church, and that St. Patrick built
some of the churches. I don’t remember the verse,
though. Do you, Kathleen?”</p>

<p>“That I do,” said her sister, and she sang to
an odd little tune:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Of ‘Killys’ and ‘Kils’ there are many.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s Kildare and Kilmaine and Kilkenny,</div>

    <div class="verse indent4">Killimore, Killyleagh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kilworth and Kilcock and Kilkelly.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Good enough,” said Patrick, clapping his hands
and laughing so heartily that everyone else laughed.</p>

<p>“There are dozens of ‘ballys,’ too,” said Mary
Ellen, when the laughter was over. “Kathleen
made a list of them, and Father said they would
make a whole string of verses, but he didn’t get
time for it yet. ‘Bally means town,’ he said.”</p>

<p>“Did the chiefs ever have any sports besides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
hunting?” asked Danny, who was fond of sports
and had tried many a running race with the boys
at Farmer Flynn’s.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” Patrick replied. “Over in Leinster
they held a great fair once in every three years,
and they had games and chariot races and horse
races. People went to the fair from miles around,
and the harpers and story-tellers always planned
their wanderings so as to be there for the three
days.”</p>

<p>“It must have been something like market day,”
said Kathleen, who could not forget the crowd she
saw at the Letterkenny market.</p>

<p>“There was marketing, too,” said Patrick. “It
wouldn’t be Ireland without marketing. There was
selling and buying of horses, sheep, and pigs, and
all sorts of hand-made gold and bronze ornaments.
The country was famous for her hand-crafts then;
and she will be so again some day, praise be!”</p>

<p>“There couldn’t have been such pig markets as
the one we saw yesterday,” said Danny, laughing
at the thought of the hundreds of squealing pigs in
the Letterkenny streets.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Bee. “It took
them two years to get ready for the Leinster fairs,
and we go to market in Boyle twice a week.”</p>

<p>“I should be on my way there now, instead of
sitting here talking as if I’d nothing to do,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
Patrick. “I want to see Tim Keefe about buying
the heifer come Saturday. Have you any eggs to
send, Bridget mavourneen? And will you go with
me, Danny, my boy?”</p>

<p>Danny went out to help Patrick harness the mule,
Mary Ellen held the creel while Kathleen counted
out five score of eggs, and Bee packed ten pounds
of beautiful, golden butter into the market basket.</p>

<p>“There, Patrick avic,” she said, as she followed
him to the barn and put the basket into the trap,
“bring me back a good bit of silver for my work,
and a ribbon apiece for the children. I’ll have them
watching for you when you come home.”</p>

<p>“This is the best day to sell the butter,” she said
to Kathleen, as the trap disappeared down the boreen
toward the road. “There’ll be people buying everything
you can name, from butter and eggs to needles
and pins and imitation gold chains, at the Wednesday
market.”</p>

<p>“What will they buy in the Saturday market?”
asked the child.</p>

<p>“Pigs, calves, sheep and wool, hay, potatoes, and
every kind of vegetable that grows,” was the answer.
“I’m raising a little pig that I’m going to
take to the Saturday market myself some day; and
Patrick’s heifer is the best in Boyle for its age. Tim
Keefe ought to give him a good price for it.”</p>

<p>Then she took Kathleen into the barn and showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
her the heifer and the little pig, the two baby donkeys,
the hens and the geese.</p>

<p>“If we get everything well started in the garden
we will go on a picnic to Lough Gara come May-day,
and you shall stay and go with us,” she said,
leading Kathleen into the garden.</p>

<p>Such a pretty garden it was, too! Paths bordered
with box led through beds of lilies and roses; and
there were beds of cowslips and hollyhocks and
many another sweet, old-fashioned flower.</p>

<p>After they had walked up and down the little
paths and looked at all the buds and blossoms,
they went back into the kitchen, where Kathleen
washed the dishes while Bee put the bread to
bake in the Irish baking-oven. This oven looks
like a kettle and it stands on four feet among
the burning peat with more peat heaped on the
cover.</p>

<p>“If Mary Ellen could see, and I was going to
live here always, and Father could come back and
live here, too, and Danny need never go to America,
this would be the prettiest farm and the best place
in the whole world,” Kathleen said to herself with
a long sigh.</p>

<p>Bee heard the sigh and asked what it meant.</p>

<p>“I’m wishing I could find some way to bring
Mary Ellen’s eyesight back,” Kathleen told her.</p>

<p>“Was she born blind?” questioned Bee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span></p>

<p>“No,” said Kathleen, “but her eyes were weak
when she born, and when Grandma Barry came to
live with us she said it was the smoke of the peat
that had taken the sight away altogether. That was
how it came about that Father made a chimney for
the cottage, so that the smoke could go out instead
of spreading through the room.”</p>

<p>“There has been a good deal of blindness in Ireland
from the smoke of burning peat in the houses,”
said Bee, looking thankfully at her own broad chimney
and deep fireplace.</p>

<p>“Hark!” said Kathleen suddenly, “there’s the
child calling this minute,” and she ran out into the
garden to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen had been exploring the little farm
for herself. She had found her way through the
garden to the old fort and was catching the pink
and white petals as they drifted down to her from
the trees. An old magpie had built his nest in the
tree over her head and he was scolding so angrily
that the child was afraid of him.</p>

<p>“Was it only a bird, Kathleen dear?” she asked,
when her sister tried to quiet her by telling her just
how funny he looked, sitting up there in the tree
and opening and shutting his big bill. “Faith, I
thought it was an ogre!”</p>

<p>“That’s the very magpie that steals my young
turkeys,” said Bee, who had run out after Kathleen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
“If you children will find a way to drive him off I
will give you a shilling.”</p>

<p>Then she left the little girls to play by themselves,
and Mary Ellen lay on the grass among the spring
blossoms while Kathleen sat down beside her to tell
her a long story.</p>

<p>“This is a truly fairy rath,” she began, “and
Cousin Bee’s farm is the fortune fairy’s palace.”</p>

<p>And Cousin Bee, putting her cream into the churn,
said to herself, “Sure, the farm is big enough to
keep both the children for awhile. I’ll let Kathleen
stay on with Mary Ellen till her Aunt Hannah sends
for her again.”</p>

<p class="center">MAY-DAY ON LOUGH GARA</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">It’s</span> the cute way nature has with her!” exclaimed
Kathleen, holding up her face for the white-thorn
petals to blow down upon it. She and
Mary Ellen had been to the old rath after flowers
for the May-baskets, and were returning to the cottage,
where Cousin Bee was waiting to take them to
Lough Gara for the May-day picnic. A breeze was
scattering the petals from the trees, which were “as
white with bloom as the snow of one night,” and
Mary Ellen turned her face to the sky so that she,
too, might feel the soft shower.</p>

<p>“Sure, nature has a cute way,” Kathleen repeated.
“When a cloud hides the bright sun and you’d
think an Irish rain was going to fall the next minute,
the wind gives a laugh and sends a snowstorm instead;
and here it is the first day of May, and the
blackbirds are singing in the meadow.”</p>

<p>“Can you see the snow on the mountains far
away?” asked Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>“No, but the white chalk cliffs shine like snow,”
replied Kathleen. “It seems as if we must forget,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
here in Tonroe, about the mountains and the cold,
snowy winter. When I wake up in the morning
and hear the lark singing his way up into the sky,
and smell the May-bloom through the window, I
almost forget the gray stones and low clouds of
purple Donegal.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind the old black crows that used to
call over the hills all day long?” asked Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>“Of caws! Of caws!” croaked Kathleen, so
much like an old crow that her sister made her do
it again and again, “to remind her of home,” she
said.</p>

<p>The children had been at Cousin Bee’s little farm
in Tonroe for over two weeks, and Danny had made
himself so useful that Patrick offered him good
wages to stay and help him through the planting
season.</p>

<p>“Sure, I care more for work than for anything
else just now,” Danny made answer, and he rolled
up his sleeves and went to work with a will.</p>

<p>“There’s no need for Kathleen to go to Kilkenny
either, now that the school is near to closing for
the summer,” Bee suggested.</p>

<p>So Kathleen washed the dishes and watched the
young turkeys. She fed the hens and found their
eggs when they stole nests in the little village of
grain-stacks in the hay-haggard. And, best of all,
she found an old cow-bell in the barn and set Mary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Ellen to ringing it every time the thieving magpie
came back to his nest, until he was glad to take his
family away to live in a quieter neighborhood and
leave the young turkeys to wander through the old
rath in safety.</p>

<p>In fact, she made herself so useful that Uncle
Barney, over in Killaraght, nodded his head when
he heard of it, and Grandmother Connell said in the
old Gaelic, which looks in print as if it might be
fairy speech, “Kathleen always had good sense and
handy ways.”</p>

<p>And now it was May-day at last, and the little
family had been busy all the morning getting ready
for the picnic.</p>

<p>“Come, children,” called Bee from the house door,
“here are Norah Higgins and Hannah Kelley waiting
for us, and Patrick and Danny have gone on
ahead for the boat.”</p>

<p>Then off they all went down the lane, between the
hedges of pink hawthorn, purple lilac and gleaming
golden gorse, across the fields, and along the green
bank of the river.</p>

<p>A neighbor who was driving his family down to
the lake in a jaunting-car stopped to ask them why
they weren’t riding themselves, but Bee said she
thought it was far more pleasant to walk, and they
trudged along, talking and laughing merrily.</p>

<p class="p2"></p>

<p class="caption"><a href="#Page_58"><i> Page 58</i></a></p>
</div>
<p class="p2"></p>

<p>Pink and white mayflowers, blue wall-flowers and
yellow daffies grew under their feet, and the fields
were full of blue-bells. Robins and thrushes sang
over their heads, and in the distance they heard the
sound of a hunting horn and the baying of the
hounds.</p>

<p>Danny was waiting for them at the boat landing,
and Patrick made haste to gather his party into a
boat and row them out upon the blue water, so that
they could watch the happy crowds coming and
going along the shore. Kathleen looked back across
the fields and saw hundreds of men, women, and
children, all dressed in their very best, trooping
toward the lake, carrying lunch-baskets for their
May-day picnic on Lough Gara.</p>

<p>“Oh, Molly darling,” she whispered, “it’s better
than anything we ever thought of in Donegal. It’s
a wish come true.”</p>

<p>Mary Ellen clung to her sister’s hand, listening to
the happy voices calling from boat to boat, and from
water to shore. “It must be the place Grandma
Barry used to tell us about,” she said,—“the place
where happiness is so common you can buy it for a
ha’penny.”</p>

<p>Kathleen’s eyes were fixed on the green island
toward which Danny was rowing them. “It looks
more like the home of the fairies than does the Rock
of Doon,” she told Bee.</p>

<p>“They do say that the fairies haunt Lough Gara,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
her cousin answered. “At night, when there’s no
one to see them, they gallop round and round the
lake, winding their hunting horns and following the
fairy hounds just as the ladies and gentlemen do
at the meets on the big estate at French Park.”</p>

<p>Just then the boat touched the shore of the little
island and there was no more time to talk of fairies.
Pretty Mary Hever and her brother John were waiting
for them under the trees, and every one was
ready to help in the merry fun of setting out the
lunch.</p>

<p>The girls plaited wreaths of flowers and oak
leaves, and crowned Bee and Mary Ellen; John
Hever found a spring of clear water and filled the
cups; and Bee set out the sandwiches and cheese
and some of her delicious cookies which were the
best in all Tonroe.</p>

<p>“There’ll be just time enough for the lunch before
we go to Kingsland for the sports,” Patrick said, as
he sat down on the grass between Kathleen and
Mary Ellen and began to help them to cookies the
very first thing.</p>

<p>“Be off with your joking,” said Bee. “We can’t
hurry the picnic like that. Half the fun of the lunch
is the blarney that goes with it.”</p>

<p>“Faith, John Hever will do the eating while we
take care of the blarney,” replied her husband, laughing
at the boy’s first mouthful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

<p>“Tell us about Donegal,” Hannah Kelley said to
Kathleen.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to tell,” replied Kathleen.
“There are just purple mountains and rocky hills
and bogs, and Mary Ellen and I had no one to play
with at all.”</p>

<p>“You should see the great cliffs over at Horn
Head,” said Danny proudly. “That’s something to
tell about! When there has been a storm, the waves
pound against them and the spray dashes up so that
it is a grand sight.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking it was up there that the giant used
to step from cliff to cliff when he was walking round
the island to be sure everything was all right for
the night,” said Bee, who seemed to know stories
of all the giants and fairies.</p>

<p>John Hever looked down at his own short legs
with a sigh. “Sure, he must have been a big giant,”
he said, “to walk around all Ireland every night of
his life.”</p>

<p>“That he was,” replied Patrick with a laugh.
“Were you thinking you’d catch up with him on
his next round?”</p>

<p>“I was not,” answered John, “but I’ll soon be
beating you in a race to Dublin town.”</p>

<p>“It’s ten years and more since I played that game
with fifty other boys and girls; and that, too,
around the policeman’s legs in the streets of Cork!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
exclaimed Patrick. “But come on then, and we’ll
see how it seems to go doubling among these
tree-trunks.”</p>

<p>He seized Bee’s hand and they began singing
“How many miles to Dublin Town?” just as Kathleen
and Mary Ellen had sung it so often in far
Donegal. But now there were many to join in the
game, and one after another the children caught
hold of hands and ran in and out among the trees,
singing and shouting.</p>

<p>When Patrick thought they had had enough of
the game he led them all down to the boat and
pushed off for the sports at the Kingsland shore.</p>

<p>Never before, Kathleen thought, had so many
things happened in one day. There were bicycle-races,
hurdle-races, foot-races, sack-races and a tug-of-war.
There was leaping, and jumping, and
running, and it seemed as if Danny was in
everything.</p>

<p>Such shouting and cheering she had never even
dreamed of! And when Danny won the long-distance
run, she found herself jumping up and
down and shouting as loudly as any one.</p>

<p>“I could have won that first dash, too, if Tim
Keefe hadn’t stolen the start,” said Danny wrathfully,
as he brought up his prize to show to his
cousins.</p>

<p>“The prize for that race was a mirror, anyway,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
said Patrick consolingly, “and you’ve little use for
one now. But as for Tim Keefe, with his old pipe
in his mouth, he needs it to see himself for a
spalpeen.”</p>

<p>After the fun was all over they went home together
across the fields, filling their arms with great
branches of the pink and white hawthorn blossoms;
but at the boreen they had to start running, for a
sudden shower fell to drive them into the house
the quicker.</p>

<p>Just as the children were going off to bed that
night, Kathleen went softly up to Bee and put her
arm shyly around her cousin’s plump waist. “It’s
thankful I am to you and Patrick for the happy
day,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Bee gave her a good hug and a hearty kiss as she
answered, “’Tis you and little Mary Ellen that
make all the days happy for me.”</p>

<p class="center">A BANK OF TURF</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Mary Ellen</span>, dear, did you ever think it would
be so fine to live out of Donegal?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the little sister, “I’ve been
thinking of the market ever since Saturday; and
yesterday was the walk to Lough Gara again, and
to-day is the sheep-shearing. Belike by Friday they
will begin to cut the turf. It is better than Donegal,
even if Father is not with us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary Ellen, I doubt they’ll begin cutting
out peat on a Friday. It will bring them bad luck.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will begin on Thursday, then,”
suggested her sister. “Is there any ill luck in that
day?”</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning toward the end of
May, and the two little girls were watching the
shearing of the sheep at Uncle Barney’s farm.
More than a hundred bleating sheep and lambs were
collected near the house, where they were guarded
by a trained shepherd dog and watched over by
Kathleen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>

<p>“Kathleen is the colleen that’s good at everything,”
Patrick said one day after the picnic at
Lough Gara. “She’ll milk a cow as well as ever
her great-grandmother Connell did. She’s got the
firm hand for it, and the sweet voice.”</p>

<p>“She can bake as fine a loaf of bread as I can,
and that is saying a good deal, too,” said Bee
proudly.</p>

<p>“I’ll see what kind of a shepherd lass she will
make, come shearing-time,” said Uncle Barney, who
had come over from Killaraght to get Danny to
help him. “We’ll need some one to keep the sheep
from straying away after they have been washed.”</p>

<p>So Kathleen was watching the sheep for her
uncle, and talking over the Saturday market with
her sister.</p>

<p>“Sure, I thought Bee’s little pig would squeal
himself black in the face before she got him sold,”
said Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>“I mind Bee did better with her little pig than
Patrick did with his big heifer,” Kathleen replied
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t Patrick been trying to sell his heifer to
Tim Keefe ever since we came to Tonroe?” Kathleen
answered. “Faith, he only finished the bargain
last Saturday; and it was Uncle Barney that
brought it about then, else they’d still be a-higgling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span></p>

<p>“What’s this you are saying?” asked Patrick,
who was selecting another sheep to shear.</p>

<p>“We’re saying that Bee makes a better bargain
than you,” Kathleen told him.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“She got half as much for her pig as you did for
the heifer, and the heifer was costing her feed all
the four weeks you were making the bargain.”</p>

<p>Patrick threw back his head with a great laugh.
“Here’s the child for you,” he called to Uncle
Barney. “She says I was feeding the heifer for Tim
Keefe for four weeks and getting nothing for it.”</p>

<p>“Tim Keefe is a young spalpeen,” said Uncle
Barney. “I’d give a pound myself to see somebody
get the better of him. It is what nobody ever
did yet,” and he smiled down into Kathleen’s gray
eyes.</p>

<p>He forgot his words the next minute, but Kathleen
remembered them, even after the sheep-shearing
was over and the turf-cutting had begun in the bog.</p>

<p>Bog-land is found in almost every part of Ireland;
but much of it is dangerous for travel, and all of
it has to be drained before the peat can be cut.
Causeways lead to the parts that are drained, but
there are many deep pools of swampy water in the
bogs, which are filled with tufts of spongy moss
and slimy tree trunks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p class="caption allsmcap">Cutting bricks of peat and stacking them up to dry</p>
<p class="caption"><a href="#Page_67"><i> Page 67</i></a></p>
</div>
<p class="p2"></p>

<p>The turf is cut out in blocks by a man who uses
a long-handled spade. He tosses the blocks to his
helper who stands waiting for them, and who carries
them to a barrow or creel. When the barrow is
filled it is wheeled away to higher ground where
the blocks of turf are stacked up and dried in the
sun and wind.</p>

<p>Kathleen begged to be Danny’s helper, and on the
morning when he began cutting in the bog she stood
beside him. As fast as he filled her arms with the
peat she trudged sturdily away and stacked it up
to dry, just as Patrick had taught her.</p>

<p>As she stood waiting for her twentieth load she
asked, “How long will it take for this turf to be
dry enough to carry home and stack under the
shed?”</p>

<p>“It takes all summer to get the peat dry enough
to burn,” Danny told her. “In August and September
there will be hundreds of little donkeys, all
over the country, going to market loaded with big
creels of dry peat. Twenty bricks of the peat are
sold for a sixpence.”</p>

<p>Danny was cutting turf for Patrick and Uncle
Barney in a bog which lay on the border of Lough
Gara, and Kathleen stopped occasionally to rest her
arms and watch a boat-load of peasants who had
hired the next bank to Patrick’s, and who came
across the lake to cut it. It was hard work to carry
the wet turf, and she was quite ready to go home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
when Patrick drove the mule down to the lake for
them at five o’clock.</p>

<p>“Two of Mike Drury’s cows were swallowed up
in a moving bog over in County Galway last week,”
she heard him tell Danny.</p>

<p>It was the first time she had ever heard of a moving
bog, and she looked at him with frightened eyes.
“Will this bog swallow Danny up?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Hop into the trap and forget it, alanna,” replied
Patrick cheerfully. “Nothing of the sort will ever
happen here. This bog is too well drained for that.
But they do say that in times past whole houses have
been swallowed up in the bogs.”</p>

<p>“What made the bog-land?” Kathleen asked, as
they rode along toward home.</p>

<p>“The bushes and trees gradually fell into the
swamp and decayed, and those that grew above
them fell and decayed in the same way,” Patrick
told her. “It was going on before ever the giants
or fairies lived in the country.”</p>

<p>“Here’s something I found in the bog more than
a foot below the surface,” said Danny. “It must
have been buried there for hundreds of years, for
the turf was solid all around it.”</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a small iron cross of
curious design and beautiful workmanship, and Patrick
examined it with great interest.</p>

<p>“It is an ancient ornament,” he said, “such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
they used to make here in Ireland in olden times.
Mayhap it belonged to Queen Maive herself, she
that was Queen of the West nearly two thousand
years ago. All kinds of things are found in the
bogs. Sometimes men find firkins of butter and
moulds of cheese which have been buried for years
and years. Bee will tell you all about it; ’tis she
that has the learning,” he added proudly, and hurried
home to show the cross to his wife.</p>

<p>There was a happy ending to Kathleen’s hard day’s
work in the bog, when, sitting among the flowers of
the old rath, with the soft wind blowing through the
trees over their heads, Bee told them about the time
when the men of Ireland were famous workers in
metal.</p>

<p>“In the National Museum at Dublin there are
many of the most precious bits of handiwork to be
found in all Europe,” she said. “No doubt they
would be glad to have this cross in one of their glass
cases.”</p>

<p>But Danny leaned over and put it into Kathleen’s
hand. “Those that are slow at knitting stockings
are oftentimes quickest at catching turfs,” he said.
“You may have the cross to wear, mavourneen, if
you like.”</p>

<p>Kathleen hung her head. “I finished the stockings
before I left Donegal,” she replied, “and the
peddler said they were well-knit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<p>“Is there bog-land all over Ireland?” asked little
Mary Ellen, who knew that her sister did not like
to talk about the stockings.</p>

<p>“Grandmother Barry used to say that Kilkenny
was the most favored county in the country,” replied
Bee; “and in one of my old reading-books
there was a rhyme about Kilkenny, that it had:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fire without smoke, air without fog,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Water without mud, and land without bog.“</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Kilkenny,” repeated Kathleen. “That is where
I am going to visit Aunt Hannah, I suppose; but
I know I shall never like it so well as living here
with you, Cousin Bee.”</p>

<p>Bee went into the house and came back again in
a few minutes, carrying a small flat box from which
she took a photograph of a pleasant-faced woman,
the very image of dear Uncle Barney.</p>

<p>“There’s your Aunt Hannah Malone,” she said,
showing the picture to Kathleen; “she is the best
woman in the world, and the mother of ten fine
children.” And Kathleen, looking at the twinkling
eyes and smiling mouth, knew at once that she
should be happy in Kilkenny.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">There’s</span> to be a big meet to-day,” Patrick said,
as Danny and Kathleen were getting ready to start
for the bog the next morning.</p>

<p>There had been a shower or two in the night,
and raindrops sparkled on every blade of grass and
twinkled among the green leaves of the trees; but
the sun was breaking through the clouds and promised
a fair day for the turf-cutting.</p>

his milk pails, began singing in his hearty voice:</p>

<p>“What is a meet?” Kathleen asked, as she and
her brother trudged down the road to the bog.</p>

<p>“It’s a hunting-party, and the ladies and gentlemen
from the country round about meet together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
for it,” Danny answered, stopping a moment to look
at the tiny green sloes on the blackthorn hedge.</p>

<p>“What do they hunt?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Sometimes they hunt a deer; and sometimes
it’s foxes or rabbits they are after,” he replied.</p>

<p>“If they are hunting a deer I hope they won’t
catch it,” Kathleen said earnestly.</p>

<p>But when the sound of the hunting-horn rang
merrily across the bog, from the direction of Uncle
Barney’s house in Killaraght, she was full of excitement
over the chase.</p>

<p>“Listen!” she cried, standing with outstretched
arms to catch the brick of turf Danny was ready to
throw to her; “listen, there’s the horn now! It
sounds so sweet I’d almost think it was the fairies.”</p>

<p>Danny waited until they heard the baying of the
hounds and the halloo of the riders, and then he
went on with his work.</p>

<p>“They may kill harmless animals if they like;
but I’d rather be able to hit your hands with a
brick of turf,” he said, suiting the action to the
word, “than to hit a handsome deer with a bullet.”</p>

<p>Kathleen’s thoughts were busy with the hunters
for a long time and she asked her brother endless
questions about them,—Where did they live?
What did they do with the deer? How did the
horses go over the stone walls and fences? Why
did the riders wear scarlet coats?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<p>“How many hunters are there?” she asked at
last.</p>

<p>“Oh, fifteen or more,” Danny answered carelessly.
“But if they needed thirty men to catch
one poor deer, they could find them easily. There’s
the surgeon from the hospital in Boyle, for one.
Bee says he is over here to-day for the hunting.”</p>

<p>“The surgeon from the Boyle hospital,” Kathleen
repeated, under her breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could just see him, and tell him about
Mary Ellen’s eyes!” she thought. “Perhaps he
could make her well before I have to go to Kilkenny,
if I only had the money.”</p>

<p>She forgot the hunters for a while, and gave all
her thought to her work, and to planning how she
could earn more shillings after the turf-cutting
was finished. Over and over again, as she trudged
from the bog to the stack of wet turf, she heard
the music of the horn,—now near, now far.
When it grew faint her hope died away, but when it
rang loud and clear her heart grew light, as if she
had received a promise of help for her sister.</p>

<p>Once she saw a flash of scarlet-coated riders far
beyond the bog, the horses at a gallop; and again
a stray hound bounded past her, within a few yards
of the mound where she was stacking the turf.</p>

<p>A little before noon Danny sent her home for her
dinner. “You are too little to work as steadily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
as you did yesterday,” he said kindly. “Uncle
Barney and Patrick are coming down this afternoon,
and they are going to bring two more to
help, so the work will go faster.”</p>

<p>So Kathleen left her work and hurried down the
road, little dreaming that she herself was soon to
take part in the hunt.</p>

<p>Just as she reached the little lane that led up to
Cousin Bee’s house she heard a noise, and looking
off across the fields she saw a horseman coming
towards her, shouting and waving his arms.</p>

<p>At first she took him for one of the hunters; but
he wore a dark suit and an old straw hat, and his
horse looked as if it could do better at drawing a
plow than at jumping a fence.</p>

<p>Kathleen ran to the barn and stood beside the
open door to see which way the rider was going,
when suddenly she saw something else that made
her heart stand still with excitement.</p>

<p>A beautiful deer was bounding across the fields!
He leaped the wall into the road, and came down the
little lane toward the house at a gallop.</p>

<p>The horseman pounded down the road behind
him, the hounds were baying in the distance, and
almost before Kathleen knew what was happening,
the deer had run into the wide-open barn door and
she had closed it behind him and was listening in
terror to the sound of his plunging hoofs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<p>Then the excitement really began, for the strange
hunter, who was no one but Tim Keefe himself,
rode into the yard on his old farm-horse, and Patrick,
Bee and Mary Ellen ran out of the house to
see what was the matter.</p>

<p>Patrick heard the noise in the barn and ran to
see if his cows had gone crazy; Kathleen ran to hold
the door and tell him about the deer, and Tim Keefe
began to shout at the top of his voice that it was
his deer because he had seen it first.</p>

<p>He had been riding to the Kingsland bog to hire
a bank of turf, he said, and the deer had crossed his
path. He remembered that a pound reward is
always given to the one who holds the deer for the
hunters, and he had ridden after it, hoping by some
means to gain the reward.</p>

<p>Patrick smiled his broad smile. “It will be
Kathleen who will get the pound, after all,” he said.</p>

<p>“But it was myself that whipped him down the
road,” said Tim hotly.</p>

<p>Patrick’s smile broke into a laugh. “’Twas
Kathleen that shut him into the barn,” he said,
“and ’tis a fine whipper-in you make, Tim Keefe.”</p>

<p>Tim’s coat was ragged and his trousers had seen
the rains of many an Irish summer, an old pipe
smoked in his mouth, and he was such a sorry-looking
figure altogether that even Bee laughed at
the sight of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span></p>

<p>And while they all laughed, there came the “tally-ho!”
of the hunters just beyond the old fort; the
dogs swept into sight, and the real whipper-in rode
up to the very door of the barn.</p>

<p>In a moment the yard turned red to Kathleen’s
eyes, for a dozen mounted horsemen in scarlet coats
and buff riding-breeches galloped close behind him,
with ladies in gray and ladies in black, all riding
splendid horses.</p>

<p>Patrick sent the children out of the way of the
horses’ feet, while he explained how it happened
that his barn was stabling a deer.</p>

<p>Then the whipper-in quieted his hounds, and the
ladies and gentlemen looked at bashful Kathleen,
who had quite lost her voice in the midst of so much
excitement. But when she was offered the pound
that Tim Keefe had expected to receive, she shook
her head.</p>

<p>“Tell them I want the deer to go free,” she whispered
to Patrick.</p>

<p>How everyone laughed at the idea! But in the
end they agreed to it, telling her that she might
open the barn door whenever she pleased. Then
they all went away down the boreen, “as goodly a
cavalcade as ever rode on Irish soil,” Bee said.</p>

<p>As for Patrick, in one breath he laughed at Kathleen’s
wit and courage, and in the next he praised
her tender heart. “You’re a good lass,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
“and you’ve earned a good dinner anyway. Come
into the house and we’ll see what Bee has been
baking the morn. Then, after the hounds are well
out of the way, we’ll open the barn door and see
the deer take himself off to the woods.”</p>

<p>That afternoon, when they were all working in
the bog, Kathleen heard Patrick telling Danny and
Uncle Barney the story of her deer hunt. “There
was Tim Keefe, on his old nag, with his pipe in
his mouth,” he said, “thinking he was the grand
whipper-in, and would get the pound for himself.”</p>

<p>“It’s a fine day that sees Tim Keefe outwitted
for once,” exclaimed Uncle Barney, slapping his
knee with his hand.</p>

<p>Kathleen heard his words and turned to him
quickly. “You said that you would give a pound
to hear that Tim Keefe had been outwitted,” she
said.</p>

<p>Uncle Barney laughed till his sides shook.
“Good for you! Good for you!” he said, and
actually took out the money and gave it to her.</p>

<p>She looked at it doubtfully, and he laughed
again. “You earned it fair, and ’twas worth it,”
he told her.</p>

<p>So Kathleen folded the money and put it carefully
away in her pocket, thinking as she did so
that, after all, the hunting-horn had brought a
promise of help for little Mary Ellen.</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, would ye learn to count the young Malones?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ye’ve only just to trip it two by two;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Of couples there’s a many,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And we’d like to count you two, too, at Malone’s!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> did two travellers receive a noisier or heartier
greeting than the ten young Malones gave to Danny
and Kathleen on the night of their arrival from Tonroe.
From twenty-four-year-old Tara to three-year-old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
Victoria there was nothing but bright faces,
merry voices, and outstretched hands.</p>

<p>No one could be shy or homesick in the midst of
so much jollity, and in no time at all Kathleen was
laughing and talking as gaily as if she had lived
with “the Malones in old Kilkenny” all her life.</p>

<p>When, at last, she fell asleep for the night, two of
the happy family stood out most clearly in her
memory. One was Connemara, who had slipped
her motherly arm around the little girl’s tired shoulders
to draw her away from the hubbub and put
her to bed. The other was Columba, who followed
her to the foot of the stairs to say, “I’ll tell you
to-morrow why they call me ‘the gentle dove.’ It’s
because I have such an awful temper. And up at
St. Kieran’s College they call Deena ‘Save-a-Shilling
Malone,’ because he advertises in the <i>Weekly
Budget</i> that the students can save a shilling on their
books if they buy them of him,” he added, shouting
the last words as Connemara led Kathleen down
the long hall to her own little bedroom.</p>

<p>As she lay in her bed, thinking over all the happy
events of the day, she heard the thirteen-year-old
twins, Hannah and Anna, shouting with laughter
over a joke of Deena’s. Then the two older twins
began a duet on the piano, and just as she was
trying to think of the tune they were playing she
shut her eyes and was lost in the land of Nod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p>In the meantime good Uncle Tom Malone had
taken Danny into his library to talk with the lad
about his plans. It was a simple story that Danny
had to tell. He was going at once to Queenstown
to take the steamer there for America.</p>

<p>“Do you know any one over there?” asked his
uncle, looking at him with shrewd eyes.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Danny, “but I know how to work,
and that’s something.”</p>

<p>“What did Patrick say to it?” asked Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>“He said he had no fear but that I would do
well,” said Danny modestly, “but he wanted me
to stay in Ireland. He said I could do well here,
too.”</p>

<p>“Did he want you to stay with him on the
farm?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’m thinking I can do better in some
other line than farming,” said Danny. “I’d like
to get into a shop and work my way up.”</p>

<p>“If you are in no hurry to go to America you
might stay and have a try at working for me,” suggested
his uncle. “I have a linen shop here in
Kilkenny. Next year, if you do well, I’ll send you
and Tara to one of the great linen mills in Belfast
to learn the business.”</p>

<p>“I’d like nothing better,” replied Danny heartily,
“and I’ll do my best to make the most of the
chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span></p>

<p>“There’s as good a place for you here as you
will find in America,” said his uncle, “and we
can’t afford to let all our lads leave their own
country.”</p>

<p>So the next day found Danny in the linen shop
with Tara, while Kathleen, at home with her
cousins, was learning to know and love them all.</p>

<p>But it was to pretty Fiona, “Princess Feena”
the children called her, with the curly hair, brown
eyes, and fluttering ribbons, that Kathleen took the
greatest fancy, and she followed her about everywhere,
just to watch the gleams of sunshine shake
out from the rippling waves that crowned her
cousin’s head.</p>

<p>As for Fiona, having been named for an Irish
princess, she talked by the hour about kings, queens,
and castles, and the royal times she hoped to enjoy
some day; while Kathleen listened as if she were
enchanted.</p>

<p>It was useless for the twins, Hannah and Anna,
to try to entice her away for a game. She preferred
to listen while Feena told stories, or read
aloud from some old book of the time when Ireland
was ruled by “a king with flowing golden
hair, his crimson cloak held at the breast by a magnificent
jewelled brooch, his shirt interwoven with
gold threads, and his girdle sparkling with precious
gems.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>Columba, too, was sadly disappointed at not finding
a playmate in Kathleen. He had even given
way to his temper one day when, instead of going
for a ride in the trap with him, she had chosen to
walk along the bank of the River Nore with Feena
to see the beautiful ivy-covered Kilkenny Castle.</p>

<p>He went to Connemara, or “Captain Conn” as
she was always called, with his grievance. “She’s
gone off with Feena again,” he said wrathfully,
“and here I’ve been planning to show her St.
Canice’s Church and the Round Tower ever since
she came. I can tell her plenty of stories about the
old Round Tower, if it’s stories she wants.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she would not like your stories,” suggested
Connemara. “Feena would never tell her
that great stones were dropped from the top of the
Round Tower, down one hundred feet on the heads
of men, murdering Danes though they were.”</p>

<p>“Well, the Danes deserved all the trouble they
found; they made enough for us, the spalpeens!”
said Columba, the gentle dove. “We were a peaceable
nation, content to fight among ourselves, when
the Danes came crowding into the land. I’m glad
Brian Boru was man enough to drive them out
again.</p>

<p>“But then,” he added, “if she doesn’t like to
hear about the priests carrying stones to the top of
the tower to drop them on the heads of the Danes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
I can tell her that they carried their precious books
into the tower for safety; and that they used to
stand at the four little windows at the top looking
out over the country to watch for the approach of
an enemy.</p>

<p>“Or I can take her down to Kilkenny Castle and
tell her how Strongbow, the Governor of Ireland,
built his fortress there nearly a thousand years ago,
and brought his bride, the daughter of the King of
Leinster, to live in the Castle. Then I can show
her St. Canice’s Cathedral, where the soldiers of
Cromwell’s army, when they were besieging the
city in 1650, used to amuse themselves by smashing
the beautiful windows and throwing the bells down
out of the tower.”</p>

<p>Connemara could not help laughing as she looked
at her brother’s earnest face. “’Tis plain that you
know the history of the city,” she said, “but your
stories are all about wars. To-morrow is market-day.
Ask Kathleen to go with you down through
the city streets to see the old peddler women in
their bright shawls, selling their wares in the little
booths and tents. That will be a strange sight to
the child, after lonely Donegal; and she’ll like it
better than battles.”</p>

<p>After supper that night she took Kathleen within
the cosy shelter of her arms and talked with her
about little Mary Ellen and her life in Tonroe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span></p>

<p>“She’s like Victoria,” said Kathleen, “gentle
and loving. I wish she could be here instead of
me. She used to wish that whole troops of boys
and girls would come over the bare Donegal hills
to play with us.”</p>

<p>But when, on the next afternoon, Columba took
her in the donkey-trap and drove in and out among
the streets of Kilkenny, she almost forgot Tonroe
and the little sister.</p>

<p>They went first to the market, and Kathleen spent
one of the precious shillings she had earned stacking
peat to buy a string of pink beads to send to
Mary Ellen. Then they drove past the Cathedral
and down to the Castle, and came home along the
bank of the River Nore, which is one of the prettiest
rivers in all Ireland.</p>

<p>“Sure, you are the fine driver,” Kathleen said
admiringly to Columba, as he sent the little donkey
along at a rattling pace behind a jaunting-car filled
with tourists.</p>

<p>And of the two it would have been hard to tell
which was the happier that day,—Kathleen, whirling
along the beautiful tree-shaded river seeing the
city, or Columba, showing to her admiring eyes
how much at home he was among such grand sights.</p>

<p class="center">KATHLEEN’S COMPOSITION</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, Deena Malone, ye’ve a wonderful way with ye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All the young childer are wild for to play with ye!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Conn</span> sang, as she led little Victoria, all
freshly dressed for supper, to the group near the
piano.</p>

<p>Deena made a deep bow to her, as he kept up his
part of the jig in the three-hand reel, while Hannah
and Anna, who were dancing with him, called
“Faster, faster!” to Moira, who was playing on
the piano.</p>

<p>The street door banged, and Columba dashed
into the house, shouting, “Danny won the hundred-yard
dash,—Danny won! Hooray!”</p>

<p>Immediately the reel became a breakdown, and
when Danny entered the room, followed by Tara
and Uncle Tom, everyone fell upon him, eager to
give him a rousing whack of good-will.</p>

<p>The supper bell sounded above the din, and out
into the dining-room tumbled the twelve, singing
at the top of their lungs, “For lightness of foot
there was not his peer;”—and clasping hands in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
a great circle, they danced round and round the
table before taking their places.</p>

<p>The only one to keep her hair unruffled through
the performance was Princess Feena. No matter
how often the young Malones ended a reel in “all
hands around,” she looked as royally calm at the
end as at the beginning.</p>

<p>After living with the Malones for a whole winter,
Kathleen found the dainty little lady as adorable
as ever. Now, on St. Patrick’s Day, just a
year from the time Aunt Hannah’s letter had
reached her in far Donegal, Kathleen had grown
so fond of the whole jolly, noisy family, that
she wondered how she had ever lived anywhere
else.</p>

<p>Danny, also, had made a place for himself and
was earning good wages in the linen shop. Not
a holiday had he taken in the whole winter until
this seventeenth of March, when he entered the
sports.</p>

<p>“Ireland was always famous for her athletes,”
said his uncle, as he began serving supper to the
hungry brood.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you been doing anything to make
your name famous, Kathleen mavourneen?” he
asked kindly.</p>

<p>Kathleen blushed to find everyone looking at her
and waiting for her answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<p>“Speak up, for the honor of old Donegal,” said
Deena.</p>

<p>“I saw her standing before the whole class with
a paper in her hand the other day,” said Anna. “It
looked as if she were reading it.”</p>

<p>“Confess, confess!” cried Deena. “Don’t hide
anything from us. Let us know the worst at
once.”</p>

<p>Kathleen had seen so much good-natured fun
among the children that winter that she knew it
would be impossible to avoid telling what it was
she had been reading to her classmates. Sooner or
later it would have to come out under the children’s
quizzing, so she spoke frankly, saying, “It
was only a paper we had to write about the learning
in Ireland.”</p>

<p>Up went the hands in admiration. “Our little
Kathleen a writer!” said Hannah in mock astonishment,
while Deena said reproachfully, “And she
would have concealed it from her loving family!”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> a blow,” murmured Anna; and Norah
said, “Go fetch it, and read it at once.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” shouted everybody. “Go fetch it and
read it.”</p>

<p>Kathleen looked at Captain Conn, who usually
decided everything for the whole family.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Conn with a merry smile; “there’s
no harm in reading it to us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span></p>

<p>So Kathleen fetched the little composition and
read it with flaming cheeks and beating heart. It
was called:</p>


<p>LEARNING IN IRELAND</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There must be a great deal of learning still left in Ireland,
but the books do not say so much about it as about
the learning of long ago.</p>

<p>When St. Patrick lived, he built a great many monasteries
here in the green country, and set the fashion to study
and learn in them.</p>

<p>Other saints followed him and built more monasteries,
and wherever there was a monastery there was sure to be a
school where the sons of Irish chiefs might study. There
were a great many chiefs and they must have had a great
many sons; but the sons of the common people could also
learn from the monks, and very often there were rich and
poor studying together in the same house.</p>

<p>The fame of these Irish schools spread outside of this
country, and in the different countries of Europe it became
the fashion to go to school in Ireland, until, five hundred
years after St. Patrick’s time, this was the most learned
country in the world.</p>

<p>The scholars built little huts in which they lived, but
whenever the weather was pleasant they recited out of doors.</p>

<p>I wish it was the fashion to recite out of doors nowadays.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Kathleen Barry.</span><br>
</p>

<p><i>B. A.</i> You can see by the ruins scattered all over Ireland
how many monasteries and schools there were. There
are ruins in every county, but those in Kilkenny are the
most interesting of all.</p>

<p class="right">K. B.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>

<p>There was a great clapping of hands when
Kathleen finished reading, and cries of “Bravo!
Bravo!”</p>

<p>In the midst of the uproar Deena pounded with
his knife-handle on the table and shouted “Tally-ho!
Tally-ho! Tally-ho-o-o-o!”</p>

<p>As soon as the hunting call quieted them he said,
“Pray tell us the meaning of your Ogham characters
‘B. A.’ toward the close of your essay.”</p>

<p>The Ogham writing is older than the oldest writing
in Ireland, and a laugh went up again to hear
Kathleen’s letters likened to it.</p>

<p>Kathleen laughed, too, and looked at the “B. A.”
innocently enough, as she replied, “It means
‘begin again.’ Isn’t that what you write when
you forget something and say it afterwards?”</p>

<p>“It will do,” said Tara, patting her on the head,
while Connie asked, “And what did the teacher say
to your paper?”</p>

<p>“She said it would do, better than some papers
that wouldn’t do so well,” answered the little girl,
and wondered why the laughing began again.</p>

<p>Aunt Hannah smiled at her across the table.
“Sure, ’tis ‘B. A.’ with the fun and laughter at
Malone’s most of the time. Don’t mind them, mavourneen,”
she said to the little girl, and then she
told the children how she had learned the names of
Ireland’s thirty-two counties when she was a child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

<p>“The children marched round and round the
school-room,” she said, “saying it like a poem, and
all in concert. It began, ‘Cork and Kerry, Londonderry,’
and went on through the whole thirty-two
names. And when any one forgot a name he
had to drop out and take his seat.”</p>

<p>After the supper was over and she went into the
den for a cosy chat with Uncle Tom, she said,
“Sure, ’tis a great pity that Jerry couldn’t be
here to see how well both Danny and Kathleen are
doing.”</p>

<p>“They’re fine children,” agreed Uncle Tom.
“Kathleen will be great at the learning some day,
if she keeps on. Perhaps she’ll turn out a teacher,
as her father Jerry was meant to be.”</p>

<p>“They’re all fine children,” murmured Aunt
Hannah, listening to the happy voices around the
piano as they began singing one of their favorite
songs; and she rose and followed Uncle Tom to
the other room, where they all sang together, “The
Day When the Green Flag Flies.”</p>

<p class="center">THE WISHING SPRING</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> was that you picked up, Kathleen?” Columba
asked, as the two were walking home from
school together one sunny afternoon in June.</p>

<p>“Oh, just an old nail,” replied Kathleen, dropping
it quickly into her pocket.</p>

<p>“What will you do with an old nail?” questioned
Columba. “Are you thinking of building
a house?”</p>

<p>Kathleen hesitated so long before replying that
her cousin repeated, “What’s an old nail good
for?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly,” Kathleen replied.
“Granny Connor told me over a year ago that Mary
Ellen should carry nine old nails in her pocket, and
I found them and sewed them up in a little bag for
her; but they’ve done no good that I can see.
Now I’m finding nine more to send to her. Perhaps
they will do better than the others. Oh, how
I wish Mary Ellen could see! She has such pretty
blue eyes, but no sight in them.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what you ought to do,” said Columba.
“There’s a spring in the woods down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
beyond the ruins of Jerpoint Abbey at Thomastown,
and they say if you drink a cup of the water,
and wish three times, your wish will come true.
We might all go down there on a picnic and you
could wish about Mary Ellen’s eyes. I wished for
a pony once, and I got it,” he added, by way of
encouragement.</p>

<p>“Oh, Columba, did you really?” Kathleen
asked eagerly. “How I’d like to try it! Do you
suppose your mother would let us have the picnic
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“We’ll ask her,” Columba said decidedly, and the
two walked along in silence for a little while, Kathleen
thinking of her sister, and Columba planning
what he would like to have in the lunch baskets.</p>

<p>“There’s a wishing arch near the Giant’s
Causeway,” Kathleen said finally. “I wrote to
Father about it weeks ago and asked him to go
there and wish for Mary Ellen’s sight, but I’ve not
heard a word from him yet. Perhaps he is waiting
till the last Sunday in June. Grandmother Barry
says that is the day the pilgrims go to the well in
County Sligo to be cured of their rheumatism.”</p>

<p>“Day after to-morrow will be the last Sunday
in June, but we had better try the wishing spring,
too, if Mother will let us,” said Columba.</p>

<p>“I’ll ask her now,” he added, and rushed into the
house, shouting first for his mother and then for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
Captain Conn, sure that one or the other would be
ready to plan for the next day’s frolic.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking this two months that I ought
to go down to see your Aunt Ellen Butler at Thomastown,”
said his mother, when he asked her about
the picnic. “We’ll take the early morning train and
have a good visit with her, and perhaps she will
take her children over to the Abbey and we’ll all
picnic together.”</p>

<p>It was a merry party that gathered under the old
oak tree beside the ruins of Jerpoint Abbey the
next day, and the four big lunch baskets looked as
if they could hardly hold enough for so many hungry
children.</p>

<p>“We’ll help you set out the lunch,” suggested
Deena, taking off one of the covers and helping himself
to a sandwich.</p>

<p>“You’ll not touch it till it’s ready,” replied Captain
Conn. “Run away, every one of you, and stay
until I call you.”</p>

<p>“Come to the tower,” called Columba, and all the
children followed him as he clambered through one
of the windows and climbed the ancient stone steps
that led to the top of the square tower.</p>

<p>As they looked out over the beautiful, smiling
country, with its green fields and peaceful river,
Kathleen drew a long breath. “It makes me think
of Donegal, it’s so different,” she said. “Up there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
it is cold and bleak and bare, and down here it is all
so quiet and happy.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t always quiet and happy here,” said
Deena. “This old Abbey has seen days of fighting
and bloodshed.”</p>

<p>“Tell us about it,” said Hannah, who liked stories
of battles.</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” added Anna, who tried to like them.</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” began Deena, “this old ruin
was once a magnificent church. It was built over
seven hundred years ago, at the time when the
English lords came over to live in Ireland and set
the fashion of building grand churches and monasteries
all over the country. This was one of the
finest of them all, and would be to this day, perhaps,
but for Cromwell’s army.”</p>

<p>“Yes, go on,” said Hannah, as Deena stopped to
look off toward the distant hills. “Was it a big
battle?”</p>

<p>“It was no battle at all,” replied her brother.
“When Cromwell’s army came marching through
the country the monks shut themselves up in this
tower; but the soldiers went by without even
stopping to look for them.”</p>

<p>“What made the ruins, then?” asked Columba.
“I thought you said it was Cromwell’s army.”</p>

<p>“So it was,” replied Deena; “for when they had
gone only two miles away the monks climbed up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
here to the top of the tower and rang the bells for
joy. The soldiers heard the bells, and were so
angry that they came back and destroyed the monastery
and the Abbey.”</p>

<p>“Did they kill the monks?” asked Hannah.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I suppose they did,” replied
her brother. “They destroyed many fine buildings
and did many cruel deeds here in Ireland.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t destroy the Round Tower in Kilkenny,”
said Columba. “Those round towers must
have been good hiding-places for the monks.”</p>

<p>“That they were,” replied Deena. “The old
stones would tell many wonderful tales if they could
speak.”</p>

<p>“Are there many round towers in Ireland?”
asked Kathleen.</p>

<p>“There are eighty still standing,” Deena told her,
“and twenty of them are perfect; but the others
are more or less in ruins.”</p>

<p>“What were they like?” asked little Tommy
Butler. “I never saw one of them.”</p>

<p>“They were round, stone towers, from sixty to
one hundred and fifty feet tall,” Deena replied.
“Some of the tallest had six or seven stories, each
story lighted by one window, and at the top there
were four windows, facing north, south, east and
west. There was only one small door, ten feet or
more from the ground, which was reached by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
ladder, and there were ladders inside to climb from
one floor to the next.”</p>

<p>“What were the towers for?” asked Kathleen.</p>

<p>“They were built hundreds of years ago, in
connection with the ancient churches, and were
probably used as belfries, and also as a place of
refuge for the monks,” answered Deena.</p>

<p>“Are there many ruins in Ireland?” asked Mary
Butler.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Deena, “there are hundreds and
hundreds of them. There is the ‘Seven Churches of
Kells,’ over beyond Stonyford, for one, and the
‘Seven Churches of Glendalough,’ too. You should
see the Round Tower at Glendalough.”</p>

<p>“Connie is calling,” interrupted Feena.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, lunch is ready!” shouted Columba,
and they all clattered down the stone steps in a
hurry.</p>

<p>The four baskets did hold a good deal after
all, and the lunch looked so inviting, spread out
on a white cloth in the shade of the big oak tree,
that the ten hungry children made short work
of it.</p>

<p>“Now let’s go to the wishing spring,” suggested
Columba, taking a cookie in one hand and a pickle
in the other, and starting off across the field.</p>

<p>“I wish you all good luck in your wishing, and
I’ll stay here in the shade to wish it the heartier,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
said his mother, taking out her knitting and making
herself comfortable under the tree.</p>

<p>“And I wish you may not be hungry again for an
hour,” added Captain Conn, gathering up the empty
plates and cups and putting them in the baskets.</p>

<p>“There’s the spring,” shouted Deena, as they
turned into a little lane. “It’s under that big tree
in the edge of the woods.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Feena,” called Columba, “here’s the
cup. Take a good drink and wish for the moon.”</p>

<p>“I shall do no such thing,” replied his sister.
“I shall wish for a book of fairy stories, and I
shall get it, too, for Father promised it to me last
night.”</p>

<p>“I wish for a new knife,” said Deena, as he took
the cup.</p>

<p>“And Hannah and I want a pair of white gloves
to wear with our new white dresses,” said Anna, as
she and her twin sister took their drink together.</p>

<p>“What is your wish, Kathleen?” asked Princess
Feena.</p>

<p>“It is a very big wish,” replied Kathleen, so
soberly that everyone stopped laughing and became
quiet in a moment. “It is bigger than a knife, or a
book, or a pair of gloves. It is almost bigger than
the moon. I’m wishing that little Mary Ellen
could see.”</p>

<p>“I wish it, too,” said Hannah earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span></p>

<p>“And I!” “And I!” cried the others, gathering
close around Kathleen as she knelt before the bubbling
spring and filled the cup with the clear, cold
water.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it will come true, then,” said Kathleen,
“if we are all wishing so hard,” and she smiled
bravely up at them through her tears, as she drank
the very last drop of water in the cup.</p>

<p class="center">GOOD NEWS FROM COUSIN BEE</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Here</span> are two letters for you, Kathleen mavourneen,”
said her Uncle Tom, one morning about a
week later, as the family were seated at the breakfast
table.</p>

<p>“Two letters for me!” exclaimed Kathleen in
surprise. “Perhaps one of them is from Father,”
and she jumped out of her chair and ran around the
table to get them.</p>

<p>“It is, it is!” she cried, looking at one of the letters.
“The postmark is Portrush in County Antrim,
and that’s near the Giant’s Causeway.”</p>

<p>“Open it, and see what it says, alanna,” suggested
her Aunt Hannah, as Kathleen continued to
study the envelope; and all the ten young Malones
stopped eating their breakfast, and turned eager
eyes upon their cousin.</p>

<p>Kathleen opened the letter and read the first lines.
“Oh, Feena,” she said, looking up with shining
eyes, “he did go to the wishing arch, and he wished
for Mary Ellen’s sight, just as I asked him to.”</p>

<p>Then she read the rest of the letter while everyone
waited. “Oh, Aunt Hannah!” she cried with delight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
“Father says he is going on to the Giant’s
Causeway, and I’m to come up there to meet him,
and then we’ll go over to Tonroe to see Mary
Ellen.”</p>

<p>Never did so short a letter cause so much excitement.
All the Malones began talking at once
and no one stopped to listen to what any one was
saying. Feena jumped up to put her arms around
her cousin, crying, “Kathleen, darling, you’ll
never go away and leave me, will you?” Columba
begged his father to let him go along with Kathleen
to see that no harm came to her, and Danny
repeated over and over that the child should go
nowhere without himself to look after her.</p>

<p>When the chatter ceased for a moment, Aunt
Hannah found a chance to say, “There were two
letters, Kathleen. What’s become of the other?”</p>

<p>Sure enough, the second letter had been forgotten,
and all was still for a moment while Kathleen found
it and looked at the postmark.</p>

<p>“It is from Cousin Bee,” she said, and opened it
quietly enough; but in a second she dropped it and
ran to throw herself into her Aunt Hannah’s arms.
“Mary Ellen can see!” she cried; “Mary Ellen
can see!”</p>

<p>Then, indeed, there was an uproar. Columba
pounded on the table with his knife and fork, shouting,
“Hurrah, I told you so! It was the wishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
spring that did it!” Feena danced around the room,
clapping her hands and stopping at every turn to
kiss Kathleen; Hannah and Anna hugged each
other with delight; and little Victoria was so
frightened that she clambered out of her high-chair
and ran to Captain Conn to be comforted.</p>

<p>“Hush, children, hush!” commanded Captain
Conn. “See what you’ve done now. You’ve
made Victoria cry with all your noise. Be quiet
while Danny reads the letter.”</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s not a long letter,” said Danny; “but
there’s good news in every line of it,” and he read
it aloud while the Malones listened breathlessly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kathleen dear</span>:—” wrote Cousin Bee, “I’ve wonderful
news for you,—so good that I don’t know how to begin it.
Mary Ellen can see. It’s the truth that I’m writing. She
can see as well as you can this minute.</p>

<p>“Patrick had the surgeon from the Boyle Hospital come
over to see the child’s eyes in the winter, and he said it was
a shame that nothing had been done for them before. Since
then Mary Ellen has been going to Boyle every market-day,
and at the last she was two weeks in the hospital there.</p>

<p>“The doctor said it wasn’t the smoke of the peat after all,
but something else which I don’t understand; but he’s cured
it, praise be!</p>

<p>“Mary Ellen wouldn’t let me tell you before, because she
didn’t want you to be disappointed if nothing came of it; but
now she’s sitting here beside me, looking at the words that
will tell you the good news.</p>

<p>“We are all well and Patrick has a fine new heifer, but he
says he’ll not sell it to Tim Keefe if he has to give it away.”</p>
</div>

<p>“It is wonderful news, indeed,” said Uncle Tom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
“Our eyesight is a blessing we don’t appreciate till
we miss it.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if Father knows about it,” said Kathleen.
“I’d like to be the first one to tell him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will be,” said Columba. “When
are you going to meet him?”</p>

<p>And then the talking began all over again, because
everyone wanted to see Uncle Jerry when he
heard the good news; everyone wanted to go to the
Giant’s Causeway; in fact, everyone wanted to
start out and see the whole of Ireland that very
morning.</p>

<p>“We’d go through Dublin,” suggested Columba,
“and I could see Trinity College, where I’m going
to study some day.”</p>

<p>“I would like to see the College Library,” said
Feena. “It is one of the five great libraries of the
kingdom, and has a copy of every book that’s published
in Great Britain and Ireland.”</p>

<p>“Dublin is a beautiful city,” said Aunt Hannah.
“There’s plenty of fine sights I’d like to show you
all. There’s the River Liffey, and the canals, and
Dublin Bay. Then there is St. Patrick’s Cathedral
that is named in honor of the good saint, and the
Bank of Ireland, and Phœnix Park.”</p>

<p>“There is O’Connell Street, too,” added Captain
Conn. “It’s one of the widest streets in all
Europe. I’d like to do some shopping there.”</p>

<p class="p2"></p>

</div>
<p class="p2"></p>

<p>“We could see the O’Connell Monument and the
Nelson Pillar in O’Connell Street,” suggested
Deena, “and we’d get a splendid view of the city
from the top of the Pillar.”</p>

<p>“Danny and I could stop at Belfast to see the
linen mills,” Tara said to his father. “You said
only yesterday it was time we were going up there
to learn the business.”</p>

<p>“It is always easy to think of reasons for doing
just what we want to be doing,” replied his father,
“but it is time now to be thinking of going to
work. We will talk about the journey later when
we have more time for it.”</p>

<p>He must have found time to think of it during the
day, and to talk it over with Aunt Hannah, too, for,
wonder of wonders, before they went to bed that
night it had been decided that Uncle Tom should
take the whole family up to the North of Ireland
the next week, to meet Uncle Jerry Barry, and to
have a look at the Giant’s Causeway.</p>

<p class="center">THE GIANT’S CAUSEWAY</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Stand</span> still now, while I count you once more,”
directed Aunt Hannah, as they stood at the street
corner in Portrush waiting for the electric tram-car
to take them down to the Giant’s Causeway.</p>

<p>“No matter how many times I count you, there’s
always one missing. Deena, look out for Columba.
Kathleen, stand there by your brother;” and Mrs.
Malone took Victoria firmly by the hand and gathered
the children closer together lest one should
stray away before they could all be safely settled
in the car.</p>

<p>“Everyone looks at us as if they thought we were
crazy,” said Hannah. “Do you remember the man
in Dublin who said, ‘There’s a big man with a big
family’?”</p>

<p>“He was wishing himself in my place, I’m
thinking,” said her father with fond pride, as he
looked over his rollicking brood; “and it takes a
big family to see a big city, for everyone sees something
different.”</p>

<p>“We saw a good deal of Dublin for one day,
even if Kathleen and Feena did get lost,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Connie, taking Feena’s hand to keep her from getting
lost again.</p>

<p>“It was easy to get lost in O’Connell Street,”
replied Feena. “There were so many lovely things
in the shop windows that I just thought I’d go
inside to see more.”</p>

<p>“Here comes the car,” shouted Columba, and in
a moment all the younger Malones were scrambling
in, to get seats by the window, while the
older ones followed more slowly.</p>

<p>“I wonder where Father is,” Kathleen said, as
the car ran along through the center of the little
town. “I’ve looked for him everywhere this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he will meet us at the Giant’s Causeway,”
suggested Danny. “Uncle Tom wrote to him
that we would be there to-day.”</p>

<p>“Then we will be going over to see Mary Ellen
to-morrow,” said Kathleen with a little sigh of happiness,
and she folded her hands in her lap and sat
for a long time looking quietly out of the window.</p>

<p>“The sea! the sea!” cried Columba, as the car
rounded a curve in the road, and there lay before
them the blue waters of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Immediately there was the greatest excitement
among the children. “Think of our never having
seen the ocean before!” exclaimed Feena, “and
our little green island is all surrounded by it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t be calling your own country little,”
Deena reproved her. “Faith, we could whip the
whole world before breakfast if we’d put our
minds to it.”</p>

<p>“There’s the sea again,” called Columba. “See
how white the chalk cliffs look, where the sun is
shining on them.”</p>

<p>“There were chalk cliffs in Tonroe,” Kathleen
told him, “but they were not so high as those, and
they didn’t have such wonderful shapes.”</p>

<p>“Look, Kathleen, do you see those men down
there among the rocks gathering seaweed?” Danny
asked. “That is the way I used to gather it for
Farmer Flynn. See the big pile of it they have;
and there is one man loading it into a cart.”</p>

<p>“And look, Kathleen, there’s a castle up there
on the rocks,” said Feena, turning to point out to
her cousin the gray towers of an ancient castle
perched high on a rugged cliff.</p>

<p>“That’s Dunluce Castle,” Uncle Tom told them.
“It has stood there a long time, and could tell
many a tale of old Irish wars.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you a tale about it now; it’s easy to
make up stories about castles like that,” Feena
whispered to Kathleen.</p>

<p>“There was once an Irish princess, as beautiful
as the dawn,” she began in a low voice, “and her
father, the king, locked her up in one of those old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
towers and set a dragon to guard her. A prince
came riding by on a horse as black as night. He
saw the princess standing at the tower window,
looking out over the sea, and he fell in love with her
sad, sweet face. So he rode down to the cave where
the Witch of the Sea lived all alone,—”</p>

<p>“Here we are, at the end of our car ride,” her
father interrupted. “Now for a walk along the
shore and a climb over the rocks of the Causeway.”</p>

<p>The Giant’s Causeway is a low rocky pier which
stretches out into the ocean about six hundred feet,
gradually sinking below the waves. It is composed
of about forty thousand upright stone columns
which are fitted closely together, the cracks between
them being very narrow but showing plainly the
sides of each column.</p>

<p>Most of the columns have five, six, or seven sides;
some have four or eight; a very few have nine;
and there is one among the forty thousand which
has only three sides.</p>

<p>“It looks like the beginning of the world,” said
Mrs. Malone, looking up at the enormous cliffs and
out over the tremendous, swelling sea,—the big
waves roaring and crashing among the black rocks.
“Those tall crags stand there as if they had been
guarding the ocean for centuries.”</p>

<p>“So they have,” replied her husband, “and they
guarded this part of our island from the golden-haired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
tribes of the De Danaans, when they came
sailing across the sea from the north some four
thousand years ago. These great cliffs offered no
shelter and they had to sail west or south to find a
landing-place.”</p>

<p>“Four thousand years ago,” repeated Kathleen.
“Were there men living in Ireland as long ago as
that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied her uncle, “and Ireland was as
pleasant a place to live in then as it is now. It was a
land of forests, echoing in spring and summer to the
songs of the birds. Wild cattle, deer and wolves
roamed through the dense woods. Everywhere in
the deep forests were blue lakes and silver rivers
teeming with trout and salmon; and the seas beat
restlessly against the coast, while flocks of white
gulls sailed peacefully between the blue of the sky
and the blue of the sea.”</p>

<p>“It is easy to believe that this Causeway was
built by a giant,” said Columba, who had been
climbing over the rocks, and came back now to sit
down beside his father.</p>

<p>“Was it really?” asked Kathleen.</p>

<p>“Of course it was,” replied her cousin. “Tell
her about it, Father. She likes stories of giants.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell her the truth first,” said his father, “and
that is that the Causeway and all these black cliffs
were made by a volcano which poured out hot lava<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
over this part of the coast thousands of years ago.
The lava cooled and cracked into these wonderful
shapes,—the Giant’s Causeway, the Giant’s Spectacles,
the Giant’s Organ—and now it is one of the
great sights of Ireland, which hundreds of tourists
come every year to see.</p>

<p>“But the people of old Ireland liked to tell strange
tales of the rocks and mountains and so they made
up the story of Finn MacCool.</p>

<p>“Finn MacCool was a giant who lived up here in
the north of Ireland, and as strong and powerful a
giant as you’d wish to see. He’d take a thunder-bolt
and flatten it out like a pancake, or pull up a
pine tree and lop off the roots and branches to make
himself a walking-stick; and he was so strong that
he had whipped every other giant in the country
who was willing to fight with him.</p>

<p>“Over there where you see the blue hills of Scotland
lived a Scotch giant, and one day he shouted
out to Finn that he’d come over and whip him with
one hand if he could only cross the ocean without
wetting his feet.</p>

<p>“That very night Finn MacCool set to work to
build this causeway of rock straight across the sea
to the coast of Scotland; and when it was finished
the Scotch giant came over the sea dry-shod, while
Finn played a tune on his organ for him to cross to
the sound of music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span></p>

<p>“Then there was the greatest wrestling match
the world ever saw: but Finn had the best of it
from the start, and sent the Scotchman home to a
different tune.</p>

<p>“Some say that Finn pushed part of the Causeway
under the waves so that the giant had to swim
home; and you can see for yourself that it seems to
sink under the water out there.</p>

<p>“There is a bit of it left on the coast of Scotland,
too,” he added with a laugh.</p>

<p>“It is a good story, even if it isn’t true,” said
Columba.</p>

<p>“It sounds true,” said Kathleen. “Do you know
any more stories about Finn MacCool, Uncle
Tom?”</p>

<p>“One or two,” replied her uncle, “but I can’t tell
them to you now. Run and find your Aunt Hannah
and the children, and we’ll all go and take a look at
the Giant’s Organ.”</p>

<p>Kathleen started off at once to find her Aunt
Hannah, and as she climbed over the rocks she saw
so many bright-eyed pinks that she stopped to
gather a handful.</p>

<p>“What’s that you are doing, Kathleen?” asked
a familiar voice, and she looked up quickly to find
her father standing beside her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Father!” she cried, throwing her arms
around him, “I was hoping that I would find you
down here. I have such good news to tell
you!”</p>

kiss.</p>

<p>“But it is much better than that,” said Kathleen.
“Mary Ellen can see. Cousin Bee wrote to
me about it.”</p>

<p>“So she can,” said her father, “and a great blessing
it is to the dear child.”</p>

<p>“You knew it all the time!” exclaimed Kathleen,
“and I thought it was a secret. Who told
you? Did Cousin Bee write to you, too?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she did,” her father answered; and
then, looking out across the Causeway, he added,
“See that little girl out there on the rocks with the
big dog beside her. Do you think it is safe for her
to be there all alone? Go and tell her that she’d
better come up here with you.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Tom sent me to find Aunt Hannah and
the children,” said Kathleen. “I think they are
over there on the sand looking for sea-shells.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go down and speak to them,” her father
said, “and we will all come back and meet you.”</p>

<p>So Kathleen clambered out over the rocky pier,
stopping every few minutes to see if the little girl
were still safe.</p>

<p>“She looks like Mary Ellen, only bigger,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
said to herself, as she came nearer and saw the
child’s yellow curls.</p>

<p>Just then the little girl began singing in a sweet
soft voice, “How many miles to Dublin Town?”
and Kathleen knew at once that it was Mary Ellen
herself, singing for happiness the little song they
used to sing together in Donegal.</p>

<p>“Mary Ellen!” she called; “Mary Ellen!”</p>

<p>And the little sister turned and held out her arms,
crying, “I hear you, Kathleen; I’d know your
voice anywhere. But, best of all, I can see you
now.”</p>

<p>Such a hugging and laughing and chattering as
there was then. Kathleen had to tell Mary Ellen
all about Kilkenny and the Malones, and Mary
Ellen had to tell Kathleen about the doctor and the
hospital and Cousin Bee.</p>

<p>“And she brought me up here to meet you and
Father,” she said.</p>

<p>“Who did?” asked Kathleen.</p>

<p>“Cousin Bee, of course,” replied her sister;
“and she and Father are planning that we will all
live in Tonroe next year, and you and I are both
going to school there. Father is to have the little
farm next to Cousin Patrick’s, and we are going to
have two little donkeys for our very own.”</p>

<p>“Kathleen,” shouted Columba, “we are going
over to the wishing chair. Father says he wants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
to wish that we’ll all get home without getting lost
again.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Kathleen, and she took her sister’s
hand to lead her back over the rocks.</p>

<p>“You won’t have to lead me any more,” said
Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>“That’s so, darling; but I’ll be forgetting it all
the time at first,” replied Kathleen.</p>

<p>“Tallyho-o-o for the wishing chair!” called
Columba again.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Kathleen, “we’re coming.”
Then she looked lovingly at her little sister and
added, “But I’ve nothing to wish for now that
Mary Ellen can see.”</p>
